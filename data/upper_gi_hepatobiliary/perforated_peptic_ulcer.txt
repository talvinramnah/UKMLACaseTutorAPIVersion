Perforated peptic ulcer
Perforated peptic ulcer
Perforated peptic ulcers are a rare but serious complication of
peptic ulcer disease
, which carries a significant risk of both morbidity and mortality. Perforation occurs in approximately 5% of patients with existing peptic ulcer disease, a condition which affects over 4 million people worldwide each year. Early diagnosis and intervention is crucial to minimise mortality rates, which have been reported to be up to 30%.

Aetiology
There are a number of risk factors which are strongly related to the development of
peptic ulcer disease
and therefore perforated peptic ulcers. The prevalence of perforation in those with peptic ulcer disease is approximately 5%. The two most common causes are use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
Helicobacter pylori
(
H pylori
) infection. It is important to note that the majority of peptic ulcer perforations occur in older populations with existing peptic ulcer disease, rather than younger populations.
NSAIDs
Chronic NSAID use is associated with peptic ulcer disease
In those who use NSAIDs for a long duration, the incidence of developing a peptic ulcer is approximately 25%
Furthermore, the incidence of developing a bleeding or perforated peptic ulcer is approximately 2-4%
The longer the duration of NSAID use, the higher the risk of developing peptic ulcers
H pylori
infection
H pylori
is a common infection, with an incidence of approximately 50% worldwide, however not all of those infected will develop peptic ulcer disease. Of those infected, an estimated 10% will go on to develop an ulcer in adulthood (extremely rare in childhood).
In
H pylori
infected individuals, the likelihood of developing a peptic ulcer is 6-10 fold higher than non-infected individuals
In a patient with both chronic NSAID use
and
H pylori
infection, the risk is even further increased
With appropriate treatment and eradication of
H pylori
infection, the risk of recurrent peptic ulcer disease and perforation is significantly decreased
Smoking
The link between smoking and peptic ulcer disease is well established
The incidence of ulcers is nearly doubled in current and former smokers (11%) compared to non-smokers (6%)
The mechanism is that tobacco is predicted to inhibit bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas, therefore increasing the acidity in the duodenum (therefore linked more to duodenal ulcers than gastric)
Improve
Pathophysiology
Peptic ulcer perforation is caused by complete erosion of an existing peptic ulcer through the wall of the viscus (either stomach or duodenum) into the peritoneal cavity. It is well established that a peptic ulcer must first be present for perforation to occur, however the reason as to why some perforate and others do not is still unclear.
Ulcer formation
Peptic ulcer formation is linked to a number of risk factors, explained in the section below
The primary mechanism leading to ulcer formation is an imbalance between damaging factors to the mucosal lining, and the normal protective defence mechanisms. Therefore, the normal defence mechanisms are overwhelmed
Normal defence mechanisms
Secretion of mucous which forms a protective coating over the gastric mucosa which is impermeable to acid and pepsin (damaging substances)
Secretion of bicarbonate into the mucosal layer which acts as a alkaline buffer to acidic substances which may damage the mucosa
Tight junctions between adjacent epithelial cells, preventing entry of harmful substance
With any damage to the spaces between these epithelial cells, normally healthy cells will rapidly migrate to the site of injury to heal the defect (the process of restitution)
NSAID induced damage
Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) derived prostaglandins causes reduction in mucous and bicarbonate secretion, rendering the mucosa exposed and more prone to damage
Reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow, therefore reducing the ability of epithelial cells to regenerate and heal mucosal injury
H pylori
induced damage
H pylori
results in gastric acid hypersecretion
The presence of
H pylori
induces a pro-inflammatory state, as when the
H pylori
enters the gastric epithelium, it causes release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. gro-alpha, interleukin-8)
Results in ongoing inflammation and subsequent gastritis, which in time can lead to erosions and ulceration
Perforation
Without treatment of
peptic ulcer disease
, the inflammatory and ulcerative process continues
As inflammation and acidic damage ensues, the ulcer can continue to deepen and penetrate into deeper layers of the wall
If the outermost layer (the serosa) is breached by continued ulceration, this is the point where the perforation occurs, as a full-thickness injury has now occurred to the organ wall
The gastric contents are able to exit the stomach or duodenum and enter the peritoneal cavity, resulting in chemical peritonitis and irritation, leading to the clinical features of pain, rigidity, tenderness and distention
Improve
Clinical features
The classical triad of features in a perforated peptic ulcer is abdominal pain,
tachycardia
and abdominal rigidity. In practice, most patients present with symptoms of an acute abdomen.
Symptoms
Abdominal pain (98%)
Very severe
Constant pain
Most frequently epigastric in the beginning, but rapidly becomes generalised
Abdominal distention (75%)
Nausea
and
vomiting
(35%)
Dyspepsia (30%)
Constipation (30%)
Shoulder tip pain (Kehr's sign)
Pain may radiate to the tip of the right shoulder, or less commonly both shoulders
Due to irritation within the peritoneal cavity from released gastric contents
Signs
Abdominal tenderness (90%)
Frequently in the epigastric region
Peritonitis (70%)
Guarding
Rigidity
Rebound tenderness
Fever (20%)
Tachycardia
Primary - from a systemic inflammatory response
Secondary - from reduced fluid intake and increased output from vomiting
It is important to note that there is usually a history of
peptic ulcer disease
, and therefore it is important to ask whether there is a known diagnosis, or for symptoms/signs of the condition. The clinical features of peptic ulcer disease include:
Abdominal pain
Typically a chronic and recurrent pain
Located in the epigastric region
The pain from gastric ulcers tends to worsen with eating, while the pain with duodenal ulcers tends to worsen on an empty stomach
Abdominal tenderness
Typically in the epigastric region
Symptoms of anaemia (fatigue, pallor, shortness of breath)
Occurs if the ulcer is bleeding and has caused an iron deficiency anaemia
Improve
Investigations
As with most patients who present with an acute abdomen, there are a variety of tests required to promptly identify the cause of the pain. A large number of investigations performed will be to assist in ruling out certain other differential diagnoses.
Blood tests
Full blood examination
Leukocytosis is likely present, however is also raised in a number of other possible conditions such as
cholecystitis
, pyelonephritis, pancreatitis and appendicitis
Anaemia may be present if significant haemorrhage has occurred
Serum urea, electrolytes and creatinine
Significant haemorrhage from a bleeding ulcer may result in electrolyte disturbances
With significant bleeding, urea may be raised (as digested blood is a source of protein)
May help to rule out renal pathology
Urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity
Will help to rule out urinary pathology such as pyelonephritis and renal stones
Usually normal in perforated
peptic ulcer disease
Liver function tests
Will help to rule out biliary pathology such as cholecystitis if elevated liver enzymes
Serum amylase and/or lipase
To rule out pancreatitis, a similarly presenting condition
However, perforated peptic ulcers can also cause a
raised amylase
X-ray
Although the diagnosis is largely clinical, UptoDate recommend that plain x-rays are the first form of imaging to obtain
An upright chest x-ray is usually required when a patient presents with acute
upper
abdominal pain
This is a useful test, as approximately 75% of patients with a perforated peptic ulcer will have free air under the diaphragm
If free air is present, BMJ best practice recommend urgent surgical consultation
Upright abdominal X-rays will also be useful, as the cause of pneumoperitoneum may be due to another abdominal pathology such as a perforated diverticulum or other perforated viscus
CT scan
If there is no evidence of perforation on x-ray, but there is a high clinical suspicion based on the history and examination, UptoDate recommend to perform computer tomography scanning
CT scans are recommended as they have a diagnostic accuracy for perforated peptic ulcers of close to 98%, therefore much superior to plain radiography
CT scanning will identify free gas within the peritoneal cavity with a higher sensitivity than x-ray
Free fluid may also be noted in the peritoneal cavity
CT plus contrast
In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, UptoDate recommend addition of water soluble oral contrast
Leakage of contrast from the stomach or duodenum will indicate peptic ulcer perforation
Improve
Differential diagnosis
While there is an extensive list of differential diagnoses for acute abdominal pain, the list can be narrowed down as perforated peptic ulcers tends to present with
epigastric pain
. The primary differentials in this scenario are pancreatitis, perforated oesophagus, a
Mallory-Weiss tear
or biliary pathology.
Pancreatitis
Similarities
Both present with persistent, severe epigastric pain
Both have
nausea
and
vomiting
Although amylase is a marker used in pancreatitis, amylase can also be raised in a perforated peptic ulcer
Differences
Pain radiates to the back in 50% of patients
Typically a history of gallstones and/or alcohol abuse (the two most common causes of pancreatitis)
In patients with severe pancreatitis, other characteristic features may be present such as ecchymosis in the peri-umbilical area (Cullen's sign) or along the flank (Grey Turner sign)
On erect chest x-ray, free air will usually only be present in a perforation. This is unlikely to occur in pancreatitis, except in very severe cases where inflammation, ischaemia and necrosis may lead to colonic perforation (most commonly at the splenic flexure)
Bleeding peptic ulcer
A peptic ulcer can haemorrhage significantly without perforating the wall
Similarities
Present with abdominal pain
Both may present with
hypotension
Both may have a known history of
peptic ulcer disease
Differences
Present with haematemesis, melaena or both
With massive haemorrhage, haematochezia may also be present
Usually will not have peritonitis as there is no perforation and peritoneal irritation
Perforated oesophagus
Similarities
Both can present with epigastric pain, constant in nature
Both are acute in onset
Vomiting present in both
Differences
Chest pain is the more frequent location of pain, in >70% of patients
Frequently have dysphagia as the most common symptom
Commonly have odynophagia
Mallory-Weiss tear
Similarities
Both can present with constant epigastric pain
Both are acute in onset
Both may present with significant hypotension from severe haemorrhage
Differences
Typically a recent history of severe and recurrent vomiting
Tends to present with haematemesis ('coffee grounds')
Cholecystitis
Similarities
Both can present with epigastric pain
Pain is persistent in cholecystitis, whilst is intermittent with simple biliary colic
Both present with
nausea and vomiting
Differences
Can present with right upper quadrant pain
Tends to be a gradual increase in pain, rather than a sudden onset
Most patient will have experienced episodes similar in the past (>70%)
History of biliary colic or gallstones incidentally noted
Murphy sign positive
Improve
Management
Prompt diagnosis and management is essential for perforated peptic ulcers due to the significant morbidity and mortality if not treated rapidly. The management may either be operative or non-operative.
Initial resuscitation
Intravenous fluids
IV fluids are necessary for initial resuscitation, as many patients will be fluid deplete due to ulcer bleeding and re-distribution of fluid to the third space
Nasogastric tube insertion
To reduce amount of gastric fluids in the GIT and therefore reduce the amount to escape into the peritoneum
Patients should also be nil by mouth
Intravenous proton pump inhibitors
UptoDate recommend an initial loading dose and then subsequent maintenance PPI therapy
PPI's are thought to enhance fibrin formation and therefore encourage sealing of the perforation
Antibiotics
Antibiotic therapy is important for perforated peptic ulcers due to the leakage of gastric fluids into the peritoneum
Sepsis is a leading cause of death in patients with perforated peptic ulcers and therefore needs to be managed aggressively (accounting for 50% of deaths)
The choice of antibiotics varies between hospitals, however it should ensure coverage for enteric gram negative rods, anaerobes and mouth flora, as these are the common bacteria within the gastric tract
Non-operative
Non-operative management is considered only if a patient is stable and/or improving after initial resuscitation, as in a portion of patients, spontaneous sealing of the perforation may occur
Patients whose perforations seal spontaneously have good outcomes without surgery, as UptoDate explain that <1% of patients with spontaneous sealing will have re-leaking
Gastric ulcers are less likely to heal spontaneously than duodenal ulcers
Operative management
Operative management is indicated if a patient continues to deteriorate, suggested by either instability of general observations or from ongoing/worsening symptoms
Involves closure of the perforation if small (<2cm)
If the perforation is large (>2cm), or the tissue is friable, resection of the lesion with subsequent repair may be necessary
Alternatively, a piece of omentum may be used to close the perforated area
Post-operative management
Upper endoscopy
Upper endoscopy should be performed to identify the cause of the perforation (e.g. malignancy, biopsy for
H pylori
infection)
This is also necessary to identify whether the ulcer is healing appropriate after initial management
UptoDate recommend waiting at least 2 weeks, ideally up to 8 weeks after perforation, to perform endoscopy as to allow for the original ulcer to heal appropriately
H pylori
eradication
After initial management and stabilisation, if a patient is
H pylori
positive and this is the likely cause of the ulceration and therefore perforation, eradication is necessary
Eradication of
H pylori
significantly reduces the incidence of ulcer recurrence
The current standard for treating
H pylori
is triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor and dual antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) for 10-14 days
Improve
Complications
If perforated peptic ulcers are not treated promptly, there are a number of complications which can lead to high mortality (reported at 10-30%) and morbidity.
Sepsis
Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in patients with perforated peptic ulcers (approximately 50% of deaths)
Over 30% of patients with perforation will already have evidence of sepsis on arrival to hospital
The septic complications are usually related to three major sources:
Intra-abdominal abscess formation
Wound infection
Generalised bacterial peritonitis
Sepsis must therefore be identified and treated rapidly, with fluid resuscitation, multiple blood cultures, empirical antibiotic therapy, and close monitoring
Significant haemorrhage
Whilst perforation is not
always
associated with bleeding, it frequently is
Perforations occur secondary to a bleeding ulcer in approximately 1/6 cases
If the ulceration and perforation causes erosion into a major blood vessel, it can lead to significant haemorrhage
If unable to be managed promptly, this can lead to hypovolaemic shock and subsequent death
Post-operative leakage
Leakage is a very uncommon complication of peptic ulcer perforation, however can occur post-operatively
Leakages tend to occur if a large perforation is closed via primary suture repair instead of resection and/or omental patching
This complication will require ongoing antibiotic therapy as well as a re-do surgery in the operating theatre
