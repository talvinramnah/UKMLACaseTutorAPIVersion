Ascending cholangitis
Ascending cholangitis
Ascending cholangitis refers to infection of the biliary ducts most commonly seen in those >50 years old and caused by obstruction, which requires immediate diagnosis and treatment.
Approximately, 50-75% of patients present with
fever
,
jaundice
and
right upper quadrant pain
(
Charcot's triad
) Â± septic shock and mental
confusion
(
Reynold's pentad
).
Common causes of ascending cholangitis include choledocholithiasis (gallstones) and strictures of the biliary tree.
Prompt intervention is required with antibiotics and drainage of the biliary tree, as ascending cholangitis can be life-threatening and result in sepsis, end-organ failure and death.

Aetiology
Ascending cholangitis is caused by a bacterial infection in a patient who has biliary obstruction. The organisms usually ascend from the duodenum with haematogenous spread from the portal vein a rarer cause.
E. coli
is the most common organism implicated.
The aetiological factors contributing to this condition include:
Biliary Obstruction: This is the most common predisposing factor, and can be due to:
Gallstones: They are the primary cause in many patients.
Benign biliary strictures: From chronic pancreatitis or post-operative changes.
Malignant obstructions: Such as
cholangiocarcinoma
or pancreatic carcinoma.
Parasitic infections: For instance, liver flukes such as
Clonorchis sinensis
or
Opisthorchis viverrini
.
Biliary stents or drainage procedures: These can introduce bacteria or result in stasis (e.g.  endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)

Pathophysiology
Ascending cholangitis, also known as acute cholangitis, is an infection of the biliary tract that typically occurs due to bacterial invasion. The pathophysiology involves a combination of biliary obstruction and subsequent infection.
Initially, there is an obstruction within the bile ducts. This can be caused by choledocholithiasis (bile duct stones), benign or malignant strictures, or other obstructive lesions. The obstruction leads to stasis of bile, which normally has antimicrobial properties due to its detergent effect on bacterial cell walls and its immunoglobulin content.
The stasis of bile creates an environment conducive to bacterial growth. Bacteria from the duodenum ascend through the sphincter of Oddi into the common bile duct. Common pathogens include
Escherichia coli
,
Klebsiella species
, and
Enterococcus species
. The presence of bacteria in the bile leads to inflammation and infection within the biliary tree.
The increased pressure within the obstructed ducts causes translocation of bacteria and toxins into the bloodstream. This results in bacteraemia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Clinically, this manifests as
fever
, chills, rigors,
jaundice
, and
right upper quadrant pain
—collectively known as Charcot’s triad. In severe cases,
hypotension
and mental status changes may occur (Reynolds' pentad), indicating sepsis.
The immune response to infection includes activation of neutrophils and macrophages within the liver and biliary system. These cells release cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), which further propagate inflammation but also contribute to systemic symptoms such as fever.
Histologically, ascending cholangitis is characterised by infiltration of neutrophils into the periductal tissues. There may be evidence of abscess formation in severe cases. Chronic or recurrent episodes can lead to fibrosis and stricture formation within the bile ducts.
In summary, ascending cholangitis results from a combination of biliary obstruction leading to stasis of bile followed by bacterial infection ascending from the duodenum. The ensuing inflammatory response contributes both to local tissue damage within the biliary tree and systemic manifestations associated with sepsis.

Clinical features
Ascending Cholangitis, also known as acute cholangitis, is a life-threatening infection of the biliary tract, typically resulting from biliary obstruction and stasis which facilitate bacterial ascent from the duodenum into the bile ducts. The clinical presentation of ascending cholangitis can vary from mild symptoms to severe sepsis; however, the classical diagnostic triad (Charcot's Triad) and the associated pentad are fundamental to identifying this condition.
Charcot's Triad:
This triad includes
jaundice
,
fever
with or without rigours, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain.
Jaundice:
This is due to obstruction of the bile ducts leading to an increase in serum bilirubin levels. It typically presents as yellowing of the skin, sclera, and mucous membranes.
Fever and Rigours:
Systemic symptoms such as fever with or without rigours (chills) indicate the presence of systemic infection (bacteraemia). Patients may also present with malaise, anorexia, and other non-specific systemic symptoms.
RUQ Abdominal Pain:
Patients often report abdominal pain located in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. The pain can be constant, cramping or colicky in nature and may radiate to the right shoulder or back.
Reynolds' Pentad:
In severe cases or advanced disease, Charcot's triad may be accompanied by
hypotension
and mental
confusion
, forming Reynolds' Pentad. The presence of this pentad suggests acute cholangitis with an increased risk of septic shock, indicating a medical emergency.
Additional Clinical Features:
Depending upon the severity and duration of the condition, patients may also exhibit signs of dehydration, sepsis or septic shock such as
tachycardia
, hypotension, tachypnoea and altered mental status. Abdominal examination can reveal tenderness in the RUQ with or without a palpable gallbladder.

Investigations
The diagnosis of ascending cholangitis primarily involves laboratory investigations and imaging to confirm the presence of biliary obstruction and infection. The goal is to identify the cause and severity of the obstruction, as well as to assess for any complications.
Laboratory Tests
Blood Tests:
Full Blood Count (FBC): Leukocytosis is common; haemoglobin levels can indicate anaemia.
Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are indicative of cholestasis. Transaminases may be elevated.
C-Reactive Protein (CRP): Elevated in response to inflammation.
Blood Cultures: Positive in approximately 20-30% of cases, important for guiding antibiotic therapy.
Serology:
Tests for viral hepatitides, if viral aetiology is suspected.
Imaging Studies
Ultrasound (US):
First-line imaging modality to assess for biliary dilation and potential causes such as stones or strictures.
May identify gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, suggestive of
cholecystitis
.
Computed Tomography (CT):
Useful in complicated cases or where ultrasound is inconclusive.
Provides detailed information on biliary and pancreatic anatomy, and can assess for local complications such as abscesses.
Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP):
Non-invasive alternative to ERCP that provides detailed images of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.
Indicated to delineate anatomy before potential interventions.
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):
Diagnostic and therapeutic tool used for identifying and managing biliary obstruction.
Allows for direct visualization, biopsy, and intervention such as stent placement or stone removal.

Management
Patients with ascending cholangitis should be managed in hospital as this considered an emergency condition and
fluid resuscitation
to initially stabilise the patient will be required, followed by prompt
drainage of the biliary tree
.
The following management has been adapted from NICE guidelines and BMJ best practice, with initial treatment including:
Intravenous antibiotics
Broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy initially until antibiotic treatment can be guided with blood cultures
Majority of cases are
gram-negative
, but
gram-positive
anaerobes may also be present
Piperacillin / tazobactam (or gentamicin + metronidazole in penicillin-allergic patients) with the aim to convert to oral antibiotics once biliary drainage has been achieved
Intravenous hydration
Fluid status and resuscitation
Maintenance fluids Â± bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride
Correct electrolyte imbalances + coagulation abnormalities
Fresh frozen plasma
may be required for clotting abnormalities, especially in septic patients
Analgesia
Using the WHO Analgesic Pain Ladder
Initiate the
Sepsis 6
protocol if suspected within 1 hour
Biliary decompression
is ultimately required to treat ascending cholangitis either non-operatively or through surgery:
Non-operative management
ERCP
Â± sphincterotomy
Insertion of
biliary stent
to allow drainage of bile
Percutaneous trans-hepatic cholangiography
(PTC) for those with stricture / malignancy or previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
Nasobiliary drain
Surgical management
Non-operative procedures are preferred due to the increased risks of surgery (
bleeding, infection, abscess formation
)
Cholecystectomy
Â± common bile duct exploration
Choledochotomy
with T-tube placement

distal common bile duct stone
Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (
Asiatic cholangitis
)
Chronic infection of bacterial cholangitis with primary hepatolithiasis
Exclusive to those living in South-East Asia, due to the presence of
calcium bilirubinate stones
attributed to high incidence of
