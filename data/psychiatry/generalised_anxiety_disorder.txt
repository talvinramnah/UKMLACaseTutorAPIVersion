Differential diagnosis
Always look for a potential physical cause when considering a psychiatric diagnosis. In
anxiety
disorders, important alternative causes include hyperthyroidism, cardiac disease and medication-induced anxiety (NICE). Medications that may trigger anxiety include salbutamol, theophylline, corticosteroids, antidepressants and caffeine

Management
NICE suggest a step-wise approach:
step 1: education about GAD + active monitoring
step 2: low intensity psychological interventions (individual non-facilitated self-help or individual guided self-help or psychoeducational groups)
step 3: high intensity psychological interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy or applied relaxation) or drug treatment. See drug treatment below for more information
step 4: highly specialist input e.g. Multi agency teams
Drug treatment
NICE suggest sertraline should be considered the first-line
SSRI
interestingly for patients under the age of 30 years NICE recommend you warn patients of the increased risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm. Weekly follow-up is recommended for the first month
Management of panic disorder
Again a stepwise approach:
step 1: recognition and diagnosis
step 2: treatment in primary care - see below
step 3: review and consideration of alternative treatments
step 4: review and referral to specialist mental health services
step 5: care in specialist mental health services
Treatment in primary care
NICE recommend either cognitive behavioural therapy or drug treatment
SSRIs
are first-line. If contraindicated or no response after 12 weeks then imipramine or clomipramine should be offered
