Panic disorder
Panic disorder
Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes and are accompanied by physical symptoms such as
palpitations
,
sweating
, trembling, and
shortness of breath
.
The diagnosis of panic disorder is based on the presence of recurrent panic attacks and the persistent fear of having additional attacks. Treatment options include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines are commonly used medications for panic disorder. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective psychotherapy approach that helps patients identify and modify negative thoughts and behaviours associated with panic attacks.
