Post-traumatic stress disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition triggered by exposure to traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, or severe accidents. It is characterised by intrusive memories of the trauma, avoidance of stimuli associated with the event, alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal symptoms. PTSD can lead to significant distress and impairment in social, occupational and other important areas of functioning.
The pathophysiology involves dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leading to abnormal cortisol levels, increased amygdala activity causing heightened fear responses and decreased hippocampal volume contributing to memory impairments. Diagnosis is made through clinical interview using criteria from the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5).
Treatment strategies include psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitisation reprocessing (EMDR), and pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
