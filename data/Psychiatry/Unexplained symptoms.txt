Unexplained symptoms 
There are a wide variety of psychiatric terms for patients who have symptoms for which no organic cause can be found:

Somatisation disorder
multiple physical SYMPTOMS present for at least 2 years
patient refuses to accept reassurance or negative test results

Illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis)
persistent belief in the presence of an underlying serious DISEASE, e.g. cancer
patient again refuses to accept reassurance or negative test results

Functional neurological disorder (conversion disorder)
typically involves loss of motor or sensory function
the patient doesn't consciously feign the symptoms (factitious disorder) or seek material gain (malingering)
patients may be indifferent to their apparent disorder - la belle indifference - although this has not been backed up by some studies

Dissociative disorder
dissociation is a process of 'separating off' certain memories from normal consciousness
in contrast to conversion disorder involves psychiatric symptoms e.g. Amnesia, fugue, stupor
dissociative identity disorder (DID) is the new term for multiple personality disorder as is the most severe form of dissociative disorder

Factitious disorder
also known as Munchausen's syndrome
the intentional production of physical or psychological symptoms

Malingering
fraudulent simulation or exaggeration of symptoms with the intention of financial or other gain
