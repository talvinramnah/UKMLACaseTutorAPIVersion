Personality disorders 
Personality disorders (PD) are a group of mental health conditions characterised by persistent patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that are significantly different from cultural expectations. These patterns can lead to distress or problems in personal, social, and occupational functioning. It is thought that around 1 in 20 people have a personality disorder.

For many years patients were diagnosed with a specific 'named' personality disorder, such as narcissistic or paranoid. This approach was changed significantly with the introduction of the ICD-11 classification which marked a shift towards a more dimensional model, such as severity and specific problems. This allows for a more flexible and comprehensive understanding of personality pathology.

The majority of patients you'll encounter with personality disorders will be 'labelled' using the previous classification system. We've therefore included details of this classification at the end of the notes.

ICD-11 classification of personality disorders

Key Features of Personality Disorder (ICD-11)
Persistent Pattern: The individual's patterns of cognition, emotional experience, behaviour, and interpersonal functioning deviate from cultural expectations. These patterns are stable over time and span across various personal and social situations.
Impairment: The deviation results in significant problems or dysfunctions in the personâ€™s life, especially in relationships, work, or social functioning.
Duration: These characteristics are stable over time, beginning in adolescence or early adulthood, and are not transient.
Distress or Dysfunction: The impairment may result in distress to the individual or others. These patterns are not explained by another mental disorder, a medical condition, or substance misuse.

Severity Classification in ICD-11

In the ICD-11, personality disorders are classified based on the degree of severity. This provides a broader and more flexible approach:

Mild Personality Disorder:
Some impairments in functioning, often limited to specific areas of life (e.g., intimate relationships or work).
Symptoms may be noticeable to others but do not cause pervasive distress or dysfunction.
The individual may still maintain relatively stable relationships and occupational roles.

Moderate Personality Disorder:
More significant impairments in multiple areas of life (personal, social, and work).
The individual may struggle with maintaining close relationships, and there may be greater interpersonal difficulties.
More distressing symptoms are present, but the individual can manage day-to-day functioning with some effort or support.

Severe Personality Disorder:
Profound impairments in all areas of life.
Individuals may experience pervasive difficulties in interpersonal relationships, self-identity, and coping mechanisms.
Significant distress, dysfunction, and reduced quality of life are common.
Individuals may require intensive and long-term therapeutic interventions.

Personality Disorder Trait Domains:

In addition to severity, ICD-11 allows clinicians to specify trait domains that represent the predominant problematic areas in the individual's personality. These are:
Negative Affectivity:
Tendency to experience a wide range of negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, guilt, and anger.
Individuals may be prone to mood swings, insecurity, and emotional lability.
Detachment:
Avoidance of social interactions, emotional withdrawal, and limited pleasure from relationships.
Individuals may appear cold, aloof, and isolated.
Dissociality:
Disregard for the rights and feelings of others, lack of empathy, and difficulty forming prosocial relationships.
mpulsivity and manipulative behaviours are common traits.
Disinhibition:
Impulsiveness, risk-taking, and difficulty controlling behaviours.
Individuals may struggle with planning and foresight, leading to reckless or irresponsible actions.
Anankastia:
Preoccupation with orderliness, control, and perfectionism.
Individuals may be rigid, stubborn, and excessively focused on rules and details.
Borderline Pattern (also recognised in ICD-11):
An additional qualifier for those showing emotional instability, intense and unstable interpersonal relationships, a fluctuating sense of identity, and impulsivity.
This pattern is akin to borderline personality disorder as recognised in ICD-10 and DSM-5.
