SSRI: side-effects 
Adverse effects
gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common side-effect
there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients taking SSRIs. A proton pump inhibitor should be prescribed if a patient is also taking a NSAID
hyponatraemia
patients should be counselled to be vigilant for increased anxiety and agitation after starting a SSRI
fluoxetine and paroxetine have a higher propensity for drug interactions

Citalopram and the QT interval
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) released a warning on the use of citalopram in 2011
it advised that citalopram and escitalopram are associated with dose-dependent QT interval prolongation and should not be used in those with: congenital long QT syndrome; known pre-existing QT interval prolongation; or in combination with other medicines that prolong the QT interval
the maximum daily dose is now 40 mg for adults; 20 mg for patients older than 65 years; and 20 mg for those with hepatic impairment

Interactions
NSAIDs: NICE guidelines advise 'do not normally offer SSRIs', but if given co-prescribe a proton pump inhibitor
warfarin / heparin: NICE guidelines recommend avoiding SSRIs and considering mirtazapine
aspirin: see above
triptans: avoid SSRIs

Following the initiation of antidepressant therapy patients should normally be reviewed by a doctor after 2 weeks. For patients under the age of 30 years or at increased risk of suicide they should be reviewed after 1 week. If a patient makes a good response to antidepressant therapy they should continue on treatment for at least 6 months after remission as this reduces the risk of relapse.

When stopping a SSRI the dose should be gradually reduced over a 4 week period (this is not necessary with fluoxetine). Paroxetine has a higher incidence of discontinuation symptoms.

Discontinuation symptoms
increased mood change
restlessness
difficulty sleeping
unsteadiness
sweating
gastrointestinal symptoms: pain, cramping, diarrhoea, vomiting
paraesthesia
