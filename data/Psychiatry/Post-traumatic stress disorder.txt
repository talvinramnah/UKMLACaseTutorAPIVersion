Post-traumatic stress disorder 
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop in people of any age following a traumatic event, for example, a major disaster or childhood sexual abuse. It encompasses what became known as 'shell shock' following the first world war. One of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria is that symptoms have been present for more than one month.

Features
re-experiencing: flashbacks, nightmares, repetitive and distressing intrusive images
avoidance: avoiding people, situations or circumstances resembling or associated with the event
hyperarousal: hypervigilance for threat, exaggerated startle response, sleep problems, irritability and difficulty concentrating
emotional numbing - lack of ability to experience feelings, feeling detached
from other people
depression
drug or alcohol misuse
anger
unexplained physical symptoms

Management
following a traumatic event single-session interventions (often referred to as debriefing) are not recommended
watchful waiting may be used for mild symptoms lasting less than 4 weeks
military personnel have access to treatment provided by the armed forces
trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy may be used in more severe cases
drug treatments for PTSD should not be used as a routine first-line treatment for adults. If drug treatment is used then venlafaxine or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as sertraline should be tried. In severe cases, NICE recommends that risperidone may be used
