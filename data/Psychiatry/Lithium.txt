Lithium is mood stabilising drug used most commonly prophylactically in bipolar disorder but also as an adjunct in refractory depression. It has a very narrow therapeutic range (0.4-1.0 mmol/L) and a long plasma half-life being excreted primarily by the kidneys.

Mechanism of action - not fully understood, two theories:
interferes with inositol triphosphate formation
interferes with cAMP formation

Adverse effects
nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea
fine tremor
nephrotoxicity: polyuria, secondary to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
thyroid enlargement, may lead to hypothyroidism
ECG: T wave flattening/inversion
weight gain
idiopathic intracranial hypertension
leucocytosis
hyperparathyroidism and resultant hypercalcaemia

Monitoring of patients on lithium therapy
inadequate monitoring of patients taking lithium is common - NICE and the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) have issued guidance to try and address this. As a result it is often an exam hot topic
when checking lithium levels, the sample should be taken 12 hours post-dose
after starting lithium levels should be performed weekly and after each dose change until concentrations are stable
once established, lithium blood level should 'normally' be checked every 3 months
after a change in dose, lithium levels should be taken a week later and weekly until the levels are stable.
thyroid and renal function should be checked every 6 months
patients should be issued with an information booklet, alert card and record book
