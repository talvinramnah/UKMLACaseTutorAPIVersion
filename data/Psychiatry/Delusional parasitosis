Delusional parasitosis is a relatively rare condition where a patient has a fixed, false belief (delusion) that they are infested by 'bugs' e.g. worms, parasites, mites, bacteria, fungus. This may occur in conjunction with other psychiatric conditions or may present by itself, with patients often otherwise quite functional despite the delusion.
