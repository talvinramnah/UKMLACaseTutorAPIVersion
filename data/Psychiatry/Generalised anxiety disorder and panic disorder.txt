Anxiety is a common disorder that can present in multiple ways. NICE define the central feature as an 'excessive worry about a number of different events associated with heightened tension.'

Always look for a potential physical cause when considering a psychiatric diagnosis. In anxiety disorders, important alternative causes include hyperthyroidism, cardiac disease and medication-induced anxiety (NICE). Medications that may trigger anxiety include salbutamol, theophylline, corticosteroids, antidepressants and caffeine

Management of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)

NICE suggest a step-wise approach:
step 1: education about GAD + active monitoring
step 2: low-intensity psychological interventions (individual non-facilitated self-help or individual guided self-help or psychoeducational groups)
step 3: high-intensity psychological interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy or applied relaxation) or drug treatment. See drug treatment below for more information
step 4: highly specialist input e.g. Multi agency teams

Drug treatment
NICE suggest sertraline should be considered the first-line SSRI
if sertraline is ineffective, offer an alternative SSRI or a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
examples of SNRIs include duloxetine and venlafaxine
If the person cannot tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs, consider offering pregabalin
interestingly for patients under the age of 30 years NICE recommend you warn patients of the increased risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm. Weekly follow-up is recommended for the first month

Management of panic disorder

Again a stepwise approach:
step 1: recognition and diagnosis
step 2: treatment in primary care - see below
step 3: review and consideration of alternative treatments
step 4: review and referral to specialist mental health services
step 5: care in specialist mental health services

Treatment in primary care
NICE recommend either cognitive behavioural therapy or drug treatment
SSRIs are first-line. If contraindicated or no response after 12 weeks then imipramine or clomipramine should be offered
