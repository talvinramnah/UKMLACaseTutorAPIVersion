Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI's) are a class of relatively new antidepressants. Inhibiting the reuptake increases the concentrations of serotonin and noradrenaline in the synaptic cleft leading to the effects. Examples include venlafaxine and duloxetine. They are used to treat major depressive disorders, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder and menopausal symptoms.
