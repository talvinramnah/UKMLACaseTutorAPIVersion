Bulimia nervosa is a type of eating disorder characterised by episodes of binge eating followed by intentional vomiting or other purgative behaviours such as the use of laxatives or diuretics or exercising.

DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa:
recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and circumstances)
a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode
recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise.
recurrent vomiting may lead to erosion of teeth and Russell's sign - calluses on the knuckles or back of the hand due to repeated self-induced vomiting
the binge eating and compensatory behaviours both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months.
self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.
the disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.

Management
referral for specialist care is appropriate in all cases
NICE recommend bulimia-nervosa-focused guided self-help for adults
If bulimia-nervosa-focused guided self-help is unacceptable, contraindicated, or ineffective after 4 weeks of treatment, NICE recommend that we consider individual eating-disorder-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-ED)
children should be offered bulimia-nervosa-focused family therapy (FT-BN)
pharmacological treatments have a limited role - a trial of high-dose fluoxetine is currently licensed for bulimia but long-term data is lacking
