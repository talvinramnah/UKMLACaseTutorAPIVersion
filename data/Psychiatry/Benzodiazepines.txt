Benzodiazepines 
Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by increasing the frequency of chloride channels. They therefore are used for a variety of purposes:
sedation
hypnotic
anxiolytic
anticonvulsant
muscle relaxant

Patients commonly develop a tolerance and dependence to benzodiazepines and care should therefore be exercised on prescribing these drugs. The Committee on Safety of Medicines advises that benzodiazepines are only prescribed for a short period of time (2-4 weeks).

The BNF gives advice on how to withdraw a benzodiazepine. The dose should be withdrawn in steps of about 1/8 (range 1/10 to 1/4) of the daily dose every fortnight. A suggested protocol for patients experiencing difficulty is given:
switch patients to the equivalent dose of diazepam
reduce dose of diazepam every 2-3 weeks in steps of 2 or 2.5 mg
time needed for withdrawal can vary from 4 weeks to a year or more

If patients withdraw too quickly from benzodiazepines they may experience benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, a condition very similar to alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This may occur up to 3 weeks after stopping a long-acting drug. Features include:
insomnia
irritability
anxiety
tremor
loss of appetite
tinnitus
perspiration
perceptual disturbances
seizures

GABAA drugs
benzodiazipines increase the frequency of chloride channels
barbiturates increase the duration of chloride channel opening
