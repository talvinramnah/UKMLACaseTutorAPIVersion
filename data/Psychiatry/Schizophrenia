epidemiology 
The strongest risk factor for developing a psychotic disorder (including schizophrenia) is family history. Having a parent with schizophrenia leads to a relative risk (RR) of 7.5.

Risk of developing schizophrenia
monozygotic twin has schizophrenia = 50%
parent has schizophrenia = 10-15%
sibling has schizophrenia = 10%
no relatives with schizophrenia = 1%

Other selected risk factors for psychotic disorders include:
Black Caribbean ethnicity - RR 5.4
Migration - RR 2.9
Urban environment- RR 2.4
Cannabis use - RR 1.4

features 
Schneider's first rank symptoms may be divided into auditory hallucinations, thought disorders, passivity phenomena and delusional perceptions:

Auditory hallucinations of a specific type:
two or more voices discussing the patient in the third person
thought echo
voices commenting on the patient's behaviour

Thought disorders
thought insertion
thought withdrawal
thought broadcasting

Passivity phenomena:
bodily sensations being controlled by external influence
actions/impulses/feelings - experiences which are imposed on the individual or influenced by others

Delusional perceptions
a two stage process) where first a normal object is perceived then secondly there is a sudden intense delusional insight into the objects meaning for the patient e.g. 'The traffic light is green therefore I am the King'.

Other features of schizophrenia include
impaired insight
negative symptoms
incongruity/blunting of affect
anhedonia (inability to derive pleasure)
alogia (poverty of speech)
avolition (poor motivation)
social withdrawal
neologisms: made-up words
catatonia

management 
NICE published guidelines on the management of schizophrenia in 2009.

Key points:
oral atypical antipsychotics are first-line
cognitive behavioural therapy should be offered to all patients
close attention should be paid to cardiovascular risk-factor modification due to the high rates of cardiovascular disease in schizophrenic patients (linked to antipsychotic medication and high smoking rates)

prognostic indicators 
Factors associated with poor prognosis
strong family history
gradual onset
low IQ
prodromal phase of social withdrawal
lack of obvious precipitant
