Antipsychotics are a group of drugs used in the management of schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis, mania and agitation. They are usually divided into typical and atypical antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotics were developed due to the problematic extrapyramidal side-effects which are associated with the first generation of typical antipsychotics.

Typical antipsychotics	Atypical antipsychotics
Mechanism of action	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, blocking dopaminergic transmission in the mesolimbic pathways	Act on a variety of receptors (D2, D3, D4, 5-HT)
Adverse effects	Extrapyramidal side-effects and hyperprolactinaemia common	Extrapyramidal side-effects and hyperprolactinaemia less common
Metabolic effects
Examples	Haloperidol
Chlorpromazine	Clozapine
Risperidone
Olanzapine

The rest of this section will focus on typical antipsychotics, with atypical antipsychotics covered elsewhere.

Extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSEs)
Parkinsonism
acute dystonia
sustained muscle contraction (e.g. torticollis, oculogyric crisis)
may be managed with procyclidine
akathisia (severe restlessness)
tardive dyskinesia (late onset of choreoathetoid movements, abnormal, involuntary, may occur in 40% of patients, may be irreversible, most common is chewing and pouting of jaw)


The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued specific warnings when antipsychotics are used in elderly patients:
increased risk of stroke
increased risk of venous thromboembolism

Other side-effects
antimuscarinic: dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation
sedation, weight gain
raised prolactin
may result in galactorrhoea
due to inhibition of the dopaminergic tuberoinfundibular pathway
impaired glucose tolerance
neuroleptic malignant syndrome: pyrexia, muscle stiffness
reduced seizure threshold (greater with atypicals)
prolonged QT interval (particularly haloperidol)


The monitoring requires for patients taking antipsychotic medication are extensive. This is on top of the clinical follow-up that such patients clearly require. The BNF advises the following*:

Test	Frequency
Full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (U&E), liver function tests (LFT)	
at the start of therapy
annually
clozapine requires much more frequent monitoring of FBC (initially weekly)
Lipids, weight	
at the start of therapy
at 3 months
annually
Fasting blood glucose, prolactin	
at the start of therapy
at 6 months
annually
Blood pressure	
baseline
frequently during dose titration
Electrocardiogram	
baseline
Cardiovascular risk assessment	
annually

*please see the BNF for more details. There are a number of specific recommendations for individual drugs, the above is a general summary

Atypical antipsychotics should now be used first-line in patients with schizophrenia, according to 2005 NICE guidelines. The main advantage of the atypical agents is a significant reduction in extrapyramidal side-effects.

Adverse effects of atypical antipsychotics
weight gain
clozapine is associated with agranulocytosis (see below)
hyperprolactinaemia

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued specific warnings when antipsychotics are used in elderly patients:
increased risk of stroke
increased risk of venous thromboembolism

Examples of atypical antipsychotics
clozapine
olanzapine: higher risk of dyslipidemia and obesity
risperidone
quetiapine
amisulpride
aripiprazole: generally good side-effect profile, particularly for prolactin elevation
