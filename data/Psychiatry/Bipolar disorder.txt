Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental health disorder characterised by periods of mania/hypomania alongside episodes of depression.

Epidemiology
typically develops in the late teen years
lifetime prevalence: 2%

Two types of bipolar disorder are recognised:
type I disorder: mania and depression (most common)
type II disorder: hypomania and depression

What is mania/hypomania?
both terms relate to abnormally elevated mood or irritability
with mania, there is severe functional impairment or psychotic symptoms for 7 days or more
hypomania describes decreased or increased function for 4 days or more
from an exam point of view the key differentiation is psychotic symptoms (e.g.delusions of grandeur or auditory hallucinations) which suggest mania

Management
psychological interventions specifically designed for bipolar disorder may be helpful
lithium remains the mood stabilizer of choice. An alternative is valproate
management of mania/hypomania
consider stopping antidepressant if the patient takes one; antipsychotic therapy e.g. olanzapine or haloperidol
management of depression
talking therapies (see above); fluoxetine is the antidepressant of choice
address co-morbidities
there is a 2-3 times increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and COPD

Primary care referral
if symptoms suggest hypomania then NICE recommend routine referral to the community mental health team (CMHT)
if there are features of mania or severe depression then an urgent referral to the CMHT should be made
