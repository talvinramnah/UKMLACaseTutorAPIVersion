Pseudohallucinations 
ICD10 definition of hallucination: false sensory perception in the absence of an external stimulus. Maybe organic, drug-induced or associated with mental disorder.

The definition of a pseudohallucination is harder to pin down. There is no mention of pseudohallucinations in either the ICD10 nor the DSM-5. However, there is a generally accepted definition that a pseudohallucination is a false sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli when the affected is aware that they are hallucinating.

There is disagreement among specialists about not only the definition but also the role in the treatment of pseudohallucinations. Many specialists feel that it is more appropriate to think about hallucinations on a spectrum from mild sensory disturbance to hallucinations to prevent symptoms from being mistreated or misdiagnosed.

An example of a pseudohallucination is a hypnagogic hallucination which occurs when transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. These are experienced vivid auditory or visual hallucinations which are fleeting in duration and may occur in anyone. These are pseudohallucinations as the affected person is able to determine that the hallucination was not real.

The relevance of pseudohallucinations in practice is that patients may need reassurance that these experiences are normal and do not mean that they will develop a mental illness.

Pseudohallucinations commonly occur in people who are grieving.
