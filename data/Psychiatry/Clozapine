Clozapine, one of the first atypical agents to be developed, carries a significant risk of agranulocytosis and full blood count monitoring is therefore essential during treatment. For this reason, clozapine should only be used in patients resistant to other antipsychotic medication. The BNF states:


Clozapine should be introduced if schizophrenia is not controlled despite the sequential use of two or more antipsychotic drugs (one of which should be a second-generation antipsychotic drug), each for at least 6-8 weeks.

Adverse effects of clozapine
agranulocytosis (1%), neutropaenia (3%)
reduced seizure threshold - can induce seizures in up to 3% of patients
constipation
myocarditis: a baseline ECG should be taken before starting treatment
hypersalivation

Dose adjustment of clozapine might be necessary if smoking is started or stopped during treatment.
