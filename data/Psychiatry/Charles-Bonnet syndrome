Charles-Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterised by persistent or recurrent complex hallucinations (usually visual or auditory), occurring in clear consciousness. This is generally against a background of visual impairment (although visual impairment is not mandatory for a diagnosis). Insight is usually preserved. This must occur in the absence of any other significant neuropsychiatric disturbance.

Risk factors include:
Advanced age
Peripheral visual impairment
Social isolation
Sensory deprivation
Early cognitive impairment

CBS is equally distributed between sexes and does not show any familial predisposition. The most common ophthalmological conditions associated with this syndrome are age-related macular degeneration, followed by glaucoma and cataract.

Well-formed complex visual hallucinations are thought to occur in 10-30 per cent of individuals with severe visual impairment. Prevalence of CBS in visually impaired people is thought to be between 11 and 15 per cent.

Around a third find the hallucinations themselves an unpleasant or disturbing experience. In a large study published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, 88% had CBS for 2 years or more, resolving in only 25% at 9 years (thus it is not generally a transient experience).
