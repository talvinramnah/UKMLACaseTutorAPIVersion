 features 
Acne is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Several different types of acne lesions are usually seen in each patient

Comedones are due to a dilated sebaceous follicle
if the top is closed a whitehead is seen
if the top opens a blackhead forms

Inflammatory lesions form when the follicle bursts releasing irritants
papules
pustules

An excessive inflammatory response may result in:
nodules
cysts

This sequence of events can ultimately cause scarring
ice-pick scars
hypertrophic scars

In contrast, drug-induced acne is often monomorphic (e.g. pustules are characteristically seen in steroid use)

Acne fulminans is very severe acne associated with systemic upset (e.g. fever). Hospital admission is often required and the condition usually responds to oral steroids

management 
Acne vulgaris is a common skin disorder which usually occurs in adolescence. It typically affects the face, neck and upper trunk and is characterised by the obstruction of the pilosebaceous follicles with keratin plugs which results in comedones, inflammation and pustules.

Acne may be classified into mild, moderate or severe:
mild: open and closed comedones with or without sparse inflammatory lesions
moderate acne: widespread non-inflammatory lesions and numerous papules and pustules
severe acne: extensive inflammatory lesions, which may include nodules, pitting, and scarring

For people with mild to moderate acne:
a 12-week course of topical combination therapy should be tried first-line:
a fixed combination of topical adapalene with topical benzoyl peroxide
a fixed combination of topical tretinoin with topical clindamycin
a fixed combination of topical benzoyl peroxide with topical clindamycin
topical benzoyl peroxide may be used as monotherapy if these options are contraindicated or the person wishes to avoid using a topical retinoid or an antibiotic

For people with moderate to severe acne:
a 12-week course of one of the following options:
a fixed combination of topical adapalene with topical benzoyl peroxide
a fixed combination of topical tretinoin with topical clindamycin
a fixed combination of topical adapalene with topical benzoyl peroxide + either oral lymecycline or oral doxycycline
a topical azelaic acid + either oral lymecycline or oral doxycycline
important points about oral antibiotic usage:
tetracyclines should be avoided in pregnant or breastfeeding women and in children younger than 12 years of age. Erythromycin may be used in pregnancy
minocycline is now considered less appropriate due to the possibility of irreversible pigmentation
only continue a treatment option that includes an antibiotic (topical or oral) for more than 6 months in exceptional circumstances
a topical retinoid (if not contraindicated) or benzoyl peroxide should always be co-prescribed with oral antibiotics to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance developing. Topical and oral antibiotics should not be used in combination
Gram-negative folliculitis may occur as a complication of long-term antibiotic use - high-dose oral trimethoprim is effective if this occurs
combined oral contraceptives (COCP) are an alternative to oral antibiotics in women
as with antibiotics, they should be used in combination with topical agents
Dianette (co-cyprindiol) is sometimes used as it has anti-androgen properties. However, it has an increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared to other COCPs, therefore it should generally be used second-line, only be given for 3 months and women should be appropriately counselled about the risks
oral isotretinoin: only under specialist supervision
pregnancy is a contraindication to topical and oral retinoid treatment

To reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance developing the following should not be used to treat acne:
monotherapy with a topical antibiotic
monotherapy with an oral antibiotic
a combination of a topical antibiotic and an oral antibiotic

NICE referral criteria
the following patients should be referred to a dermatologist:
patients with acne conglobate acne: a rare and severe form of acne found mostly in men that presents with extensive inflammatory papules, suppurative nodules (that may coalesce to form sinuses) and cysts on the trunk.
patients with nodulo-cystic acne
referral should be considered in the following scenarios:
mild to moderate acne has not responded to two completed courses of treatment
moderate to severe acne has not responded to previous treatment that includes an oral antibiotic
acne with scarring
acne with persistent pigmentary changes
acne is causing or contributing to persistent psychological distress or a mental health disorder

pathophysiology 
Acne vulgaris is a common skin disorder which usually occurs in adolescence. It typically affects the face, neck and upper trunk and is characterised by the obstruction of the pilosebaceous follicle with keratin plugs which results in comedones, inflammation and pustules.

Epidemiology
affects around 80-90% of teenagers, 60% of whom seek medical advice
acne may also persist beyond adolescence, with 10-15% of females and 5% of males over 25 years old being affected

Pathophysiology is multifactorial
follicular epidermal hyperproliferation resulting in the formation of a keratin plug. This in turn causes obstruction of the pilosebaceous follicle. Activity of sebaceous glands may be controlled by androgen, although levels are often normal in patients with acne
colonisation by the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes
inflammation
