Describes symmetrical, brown, velvety plaques that are often found on the neck, axilla and groin.

Causes
obesity
type 2 diabetes mellitus
polycystic ovary syndrome
Cushing's syndrome
acromegaly
hypothyroidism
familial
Prader-Willi syndrome
gastrointestinal cancer
drugs
combined oral contraceptive pill
nicotinic acid

Pathophysiology
insulin resistance → hyperinsulinemia → stimulation of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblast proliferation via interaction with insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGFR1)

Management
identify and treat the underlying cause (e.g. weight reduction for obesity, improved glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes)
consider topical keratolytics (e.g. topical retinoids) for symptomatic relief
evaluate for malignancy if acanthosis nigricans presents suddenly in an older patient without a clear cause
