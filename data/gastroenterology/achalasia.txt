Achalasia
Achalasia
Achalasia is a rare primary oesophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) and the absence of coordinated peristalsis in the oesophageal body. This leads to
dysphagia
, regurgitation of undigested food, and
chest pain
. The aetiology remains poorly understood, but it is believed to involve an autoimmune or viral insult to the myenteric plexus.

Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of achalasia involves a loss of inhibitory neurons in the myenteric plexus, leading to the absence of nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). This results in the failure of the LES to relax and uncoordinated peristalsis in the oesophagal body. Additionally, there is a relative increase in excitatory neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and substance P, leading to an imbalance in the oesophagal motor function.

Clinical features
Clinical features
dysphagia
of BOTH liquids and solids
typically variation in severity of symptoms
heartburn
regurgitation of food - may lead to
cough
, aspiration pneumonia etc
malignant change in small number of patients
Improve
Investigations
Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD)
usually done first-line to rule out mechanical obstruction and assess for mucosal abnormalities
Specific investigations
oesophageal manometry
excessive LOS tone which doesn't relax on swallowing
considered the most important diagnostic test
barium swallow
shows grossly expanded oesophagus, fluid level
'bird's beak' appearance
chest x-ray
wide mediastinum
fluid level

Management
Treatment
pneumatic (balloon) dilation is increasingly the preferred first-line option
less invasive and quicker recovery time than surgery
patients should be a low surgical risk as surgery may be required if complications occur
surgical intervention with a Heller cardiomyotomy should be considered if recurrent or persistent symptoms
intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin is sometimes used in patients who are a high surgical risk
drug therapy (e.g. nitrates, calcium channel blockers) has a role but is limited by side-effects
