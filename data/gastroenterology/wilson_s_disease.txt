Pathophysiology
Metabolic abnormalities include increased copper absorption from the small intestine and decreased hepatic copper excretion. Wilson's disease is caused by a defect in the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13.

Clinical features
The onset of symptoms is usually between 10 - 25 years. Children usually present with liver disease whereas the first sign of disease in young adults is often neurological disease
Features result from excessive copper deposition in the tissues, especially the brain, liver and cornea:
liver: hepatitis,
cirrhosis
neurological: basal ganglia degeneration, speech, behavioural and psychiatric problems are often the first manifestations. Also: asterixis,
chorea
,
parkinsonism
,
dementia
Kayser-Fleischer rings
renal tubular acidosis (esp. Fanconi syndrome)
haemolysis
blue nails

Investigations
Diagnosis
reduced serum caeruloplasmin
reduced serum copper (counter-intuitive, but 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin)
increased 24hr urinary copper excretion

Management
Management
penicillamine (chelates copper) has been the traditional first-line treatment
trientine hydrochloride is an alternative chelating agent which may become first-line treatment in the future
tetrathiomolybdate is a newer agent that is currently under investigation
