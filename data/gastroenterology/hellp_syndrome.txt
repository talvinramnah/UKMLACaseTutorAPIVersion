HELLP syndrome
HELLP syndrome
HELLP is an acronym for Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and a Low Platelet count. It is a serious condition that can develop in the late stages of pregnancy. Whilst there is significant overlap with severe pre-eclampsia in terms of the features some patients present with no prior history so many specialists consider it a separate entity in its own right. However, it should be remembered that around 10-20% of patients with severe preeclampsia will go on to develop HELLP.
