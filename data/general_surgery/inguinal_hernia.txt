Inguinal hernia
Inguinal hernia
An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of all or part of a viscus through the wall of the abdominal or pelvic cavity in which is normally contained, causing a visible or easily palpable bulge.
Male sex, elderly patients (above 75 years old), family history of collagen defects such as Ehler-Danlos syndrome are risk factors for developing inguinal
hernias
.
Inguinal hernias lie superior and medially to the pubic tubercle. Right-sided hernias are more common clinical presentations than left (due to descend of the testis or previous appendectomy).
Patients who develop strangulated hernias typically presents with an acute onset of symptoms such as irreducible groin mass, pain in their groin and/or abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Many other patients will be asymptomatic but regular clinic follow-up is needed as symptoms could develop over a 5-10 year period.
The management of inguinal hernias depends on the severity of the presentation of clinical symptoms. For mild/asymptomatic hernias, the treatment management plan would be conservative such as weight loss, smoking cessation etc. For symptomatic hernias, referral to secondary care for management.

Aetiology
The aetiology for inguinal
hernias
and their risk factors:
Male sex: this is common in older patients
above 75 years old, especially for direct hernias
.
Family history: this is common in collagen defect medical conditions such as
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan's syndrome
.
Previous right lower quadrant abdominal incisions: appendectomy and prostatectomy
Premature babies
Less common causes:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
Defective transversalis fascia

Pathophysiology
Inguinal
hernias
are characterised by the protrusion of abdominal contents, often part of the small intestine or omentum, into the inguinal canal due to a defect in the anterior abdominal wall. This section will delve into the underlying mechanisms that lead to this condition.
The development and manifestation of an inguinal hernia is largely contingent on two key elements:
increased intra-abdominal pressure
and
a pre-existing weakness in the abdominal wall
.
Increased Intra-abdominal Pressure:
Any condition or activity that enhances intra-abdominal pressure can contribute to hernia formation. This includes chronic coughing, straining during defecation or urination, heavy lifting, and ascites. The elevated pressure pushes against areas of potential weakness in the abdominal wall.
Weakness in Abdominal Wall:
The inguinal region is inherently weaker than other parts of the abdominal wall due to embryological reasons. During foetal development, the processus vaginalis descends through this area into the scrotum, pulling with it layers of abdominal muscle and fascia. Postnatally, this process should obliterate but if it doesn't completely close off or if there's a delay in closure, it creates a weak point known as patent processus vaginalis (PPV). This anatomical defect serves as a potential exit route for intra-abdominal contents when intra-abdominal pressure rises.
Beyond these contributing factors, there are specific types of inguinal hernias which have their own pathophysiological mechanisms:
Indirect Inguinal Hernia:
These hernias follow the path of descent of the testes, through the internal inguinal ring and into the inguinal canal. They are congenital in nature, resulting from a failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate during development.
Direct Inguinal Hernia:
These hernias occur due to acquired weakness in the transversalis fascia area of Hesselbach's triangle. They protrude directly through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and do not follow the path of descent of testes.
The clinical manifestations typically seen in patients with an inguinal hernia can be explained by these underlying mechanisms. The most common symptom is a bulge or lump in the groin area, which is essentially the herniated tissue pushing against skin. This may be accompanied by discomfort or pain, especially when coughing, bending over or lifting heavy objects. If part of intestine becomes trapped (incarcerated) and its blood supply compromised (strangulated), it can lead to severe pain, nausea, vomiting and other signs suggestive of bowel obstruction.

Classification
Inguinal
hernias
are a common surgical presentation and can be classified based on their aetiology, their relationship to the inguinal canal, and whether they are reducible or not.
Aetiological Classification
Based on aetiology, inguinal hernias can be classified as congenital or acquired:
Congenital Inguinal Hernias:
These hernias arise due to a congenital defect or weakness in the abdominal wall, often associated with the persistence of the processus vaginalis, which normally obliterates after the descent of the testis.
Acquired Inguinal Hernias:
These hernias occur due to the weakening of the abdominal wall muscles with age or strain. Factors that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as chronic cough, obesity, constipation, or heavy lifting can contribute to their development.
Anatomical Classification
Inguinal hernias can also be classified anatomically as direct or indirect:
Indirect Inguinal Hernias:
These are the most common type of inguinal hernia. They protrude at the internal inguinal ring, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels, and often follow the inguinal canal into the scrotum. They may be congenital, resulting from the failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate, or acquired.
Direct Inguinal Hernias:
These hernias protrude through a weakened area in the transversalis fascia in the medial inguinal fossa, known as the Hesselbach's triangle. They are medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and usually do not enter the scrotum. Direct inguinal hernias are typically acquired and are more common in older adults.
Clinical Classification
Clinically, inguinal hernias can be classified as reducible, irreducible, incarcerated, or strangulated:
Reducible Hernias:
These are hernias where the contents can be returned to the abdominal cavity either spontaneously or with manual pressure.
Irreducible (Incarcerated) Hernias:
The hernial contents in these cases cannot be returned to the abdomen. This can be due to adhesions, size of the hernial sac, or narrowing of the hernial neck.
Strangulated Hernias:
This is a surgical emergency. In these cases, the blood supply to the hernial contents is compromised, leading to ischaemia and necrosis. Symptoms may include severe pain, tenderness, systemic illness, and signs of bowel obstruction.

Clinical features
There are clinical features specifically to look out for in different inguinal
hernias
. The determinant of the type of inguinal hernia is usually during surgery.
The rate of strangulation for inguinal hernias increases at 0.3-2.9% per year, increase risk if hernias are irreducible or indirect. Up to 60% of adult male inguinal hernias are indirect.
The presentation of symptoms in patients with acute strangulated hernias usually occurs
within a few hours
, whereas for patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms could take years to develop.
In general, patients with inguinal hernias typically present i.e. an asymptomatic lump, groin mass (reducible or not), groin and/or abdominal pain, previous surgical scars, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.
During the physical examination, there are tests that can be performed to differentiate between direct or indirect inguinal hernias.
To test for
indirect inguinal hernias
, finger pressure should be applied over the deep inguinal ring. The finger pressure will control the hernia when the patient coughs.
The deep inguinal ring anatomical location: 1cm superior to the inguinal ligament, midway between ASIS and pubic tubercle.
To test for
direct hernias
, instruct the patient to cough, and a bulge should appear medial to point of finger pressure.
The clinical presentation for
strangulated hernias
are usually acute and require immediate treatment. The common symptoms presented are:
Pain
Groin discomfort
Irreducible groin mass
Tender distended abdomen with lack of bowel sounds
Abdominal pain
Nausea
Vomit
Constipation

Investigations
Most inguinal
hernias
are
diagnosed clinically, through observation and physical examination of the abdomen and groin
. However, it may be useful in certain clinical scenarios such as suspected recurrent hernia or possible hydrocele, uncertain diagnosis, and surgical complications, especially chronic pain.
If diagnosis in doubt or in complex cases, there are imaging available such as:
Ultrasound scan of the groin
CT/MRI scan of the groin and abdomen
Herniography of the groin (but rarely use in practice now)
For strangulated hernias, investigations in acute scenarios include FBC, U&Es, LFTs, CRP, lactate, urinalysis, group and save, CT, MRI, ultrasound scan of the groin and abdomen.

Differential diagnosis
Inguinal
hernias
may easily be confused with other causes of groin masses.
Possible differential diagnoses:
Femoral hernia
:
Similarities: clinical symptoms presentation similar to inguinal hernia.
Differences: anatomically the femoral hernia is situated inferior and laterally to the pubic tubercle.
Saphena varix
:
Similarities: groin mass and cough impulse present.
Differences: saphena varix is a localised protrusion of saphenous vein at the groin region, where it joins the femoral vein, always reducible, and disappears when the patient lying down whereas inguinal hernias are not always reducible.
Femoral aneurysm
:
Similarities: groin mass.
Differences: pulsatile swelling in the groin with a continuous murmur, weak peripheral pulse.
Lymphadenopathy
:
Similarities: groin mass.
Differences: firm and round texture, usually presented with lower limb infections, abrasions, wound in the peritoneum, carcinoma.
Psoas abscess.
Lipoma.
Undescended testis (cryptorchidism).
Varicocele or hydrocele.

Management
Surgical options
the clinical consensus is currently to treat medically fit patients even if they are asymptomatic
a hernia truss may be an option for patients not fit for surgery but probably has little role in other patients
mesh repair is associated with the lowest recurrence rate
unilateral inguinal
hernias
are generally repaired with an open approach
bilateral and recurrent inguinal hernias are generally repaired laparoscopically
The Department for Work and Pensions recommend that following an open repair patients return to non-manual work after 2-3 weeks and following laparoscopic repair after 1-2 weeks
Improve
Complications
Complications of hernia repair
Immediate (Intra-op to 24 hours)
bleeding / Haematoma – particularly in the scrotum or groin
injury to ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, or genitofemoral nerves
the ilioinguinal nerve is the most commonly injured and may lead to numbness or tingling over the superomedial thigh, base of penis, or anterior scrotum/labia
injury to vas deferens: May cause infertility (especially in younger males)
bowel injury or bladder perforation (rare): Suspect if haematuria or peritonitis post-op
Early (1–30 days)
wound infection: Redness, swelling, discharge; may require antibiotics
seroma / Haematoma:  Groin or
scrotal swelling
; usually self-limiting
urinary retention: More common in older men or after spinal anaesthesia
testicular ischaemia or atrophy: Due to compromised gonadal vessels during dissection
Late (weeks to years)
chronic groin pain (inguinodynia): Often neuropathic; due to nerve entrapment or mesh
recurrence of hernia: More common with tension repair or poor tissue quality
mesh-related complications: Mesh infection, migration, erosion into viscera (e.g. bladder)
