Tinea corporis
Tinea corporis
Tinea corporis is a superficial fungal infection of the skin, often referred to as ringworm, due to the characteristic circular, ring-like rash it produces. Despite the misleading name, it is not caused by a worm. The condition is primarily caused by dermatophytes, a group of fungi that thrive on keratin, a protein found abundantly in the skin, hair, and nails.

Aetiology
The primary causative organisms of tinea corporis include
Trichophyton
,
Microsporum
, and
Epidermophyton
species. Transmission typically occurs through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual or animal. It can also occur indirectly through contact with fomites such as clothing, bedding, or towels.
The fungi thrive in warm, humid environments, making shared areas such as locker rooms and public pools potential hotspots for transmission. It can affect individuals of any age, but is more common in children and those with weakened immune systems.

Clinical features
Tinea corporis typically presents as erythematous, scaly plaques with an active, advancing, and often pruritic border. The centre of the lesion may clear up as it expands, resulting in a characteristic ring-like appearance, hence the name ringworm. The size, shape, and number of lesions can vary significantly between individuals.

Investigations
Diagnosis is usually based on the characteristic clinical presentation. However, when the diagnosis is uncertain, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of skin scrapings can be used to confirm the presence of fungal elements under microscopy.
Cultures may be obtained for definitive identification of the causative organism, especially in refractory or atypical cases. In some situations, a Wood's lamp examination might be helpful, especially in distinguishing tinea corporis caused by certain species of
Microsporum
, which fluoresce under this particular light.

Management
The treatment of choice for tinea corporis is a topical antifungal medication such as clotrimazole or terbinafine for uncomplicated cases. The medication should be applied to the lesion and a margin of normal skin around it for at least two weeks, or until a week after the resolution of symptoms.
In extensive, severe, or refractory cases, systemic antifungal therapy with agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, or fluconazole may be necessary. The length of treatment may depend on the severity of the infection and the specific drug used.
