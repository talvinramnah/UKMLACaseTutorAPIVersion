Hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis is a disorder characterized by excessive
sweating
beyond the physiological needs of thermoregulation and emotional stimuli. This condition can be classified into two main categories: primary (idiopathic) hyperhidrosis and secondary hyperhidrosis.
Primary hyperhidrosis typically affects specific body regions, such as axillary, palmar, plantar, craniofacial or inguinal areas. Secondary hyperhidrosis results from an underlying medical condition or medication use and often presents as generalized sweating involving larger body surface areas.

Clinical features
Primary Hyperhidrosis
Axillary Hyperhidrosis: Excessive
sweating
in the armpit region may lead to social embarrassment, skin maceration, and secondary bacterial or fungal infections.
Palmar Hyperhidrosis: Increased perspiration on the palms can interfere with daily activities such as writing, typing or handling objects; it may also cause social anxiety during handshakes.
Plantar Hyperhidrosis: Excessive foot sweating may result in malodor due to bacterial decomposition of sweat components, increased risk of fungal infections (tinea pedis), and impaired footwear comfort.
Craniofacial Hyperhidrosis: Profuse facial and scalp sweating can lead to discomfort, blurred vision due to dripping sweat, frequent wiping of the face/head area, and social distress.
Inguinal Hyperhidrosis: Intense perspiration in the groin region may cause irritation, chafing or intertrigo (inflamed skin folds), predisposing patients to secondary infections.
Secondary Hyperhidrosis
Generalized Sweating: This presentation involves large body surface areas and can be associated with systemic conditions such as endocrine disorders (hyperthyroidism), autonomic dysfunction (Parkinson's disease), neoplasms (pheochromocytoma), or medication side effects (antidepressants, antipyretics).
Compensatory Sweating: Increased perspiration in previously unaffected areas may occur as a consequence of surgical interventions for primary hyperhidrosis, such as sympathectomy.
Nocturnal Hyperhidrosis: Night sweats can be indicative of underlying infectious diseases (tuberculosis), malignancies (lymphoma), or hormonal imbalances (menopause).

Differential diagnosis
Conditions that may present with similar clinical features to hyperhidrosis include gustatory
sweating
(Frey's syndrome), aquagenic wrinkling of the palms, dyshidrotic eczema, and miliaria rubra. A detailed assessment and correlation with clinical findings are essential to establish an accurate diagnosis and guide appropriate management strategies.

Management
Management options include
topical aluminium chloride preparations are first-line. Main side effect is skin irritation
iontophoresis: particularly useful for patients with palmar, plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis
botulinum toxin: currently licensed for axillary symptoms
surgery: e.g. Endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy. Patients should be made aware of the risk of compensatory
sweating
