Rosacea
Rosacea
Rosacea is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the face, causing redness, flushing, and visible blood vessels. It typically begins between the ages of 30 and 50. Rosacea is characterized by periods of exacerbation and remission and can significantly impact the quality of life of affected individuals. The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, but various genetic, environmental, and immunological factors have been implicated in its development. While there is no cure for rosacea, appropriate management can help control symptoms and prevent disease progression.

Pathophysiology
The exact pathophysiology of rosacea remains unclear, but several factors have been proposed to play a role in its development:
Vascular dysregulation: Abnormalities in the cutaneous vasculature may cause increased blood flow, leading to flushing and telangiectasias.
Inflammation: Altered innate immune response, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, can contribute to the development of rosacea.
Microbial factors: The presence of microorganisms such as
Demodex
mites and
Helicobacter pylori
have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rosacea, though their exact role remains unclear.
Ultraviolet radiation: Sun exposure may exacerbate rosacea by causing oxidative stress and inducing inflammation.

Classification
There are four primary subtypes of rosacea, each presenting with distinct clinical features:
Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR): Characterized by facial redness, flushing, and visible blood vessels (telangiectasias).
Papulopustular rosacea: Presents with acne-like breakouts, including papules and pustules, along with facial redness and swelling.
Phymatous rosacea: Associated with skin thickening, especially around the nose (rhinophyma), and can also affect the chin, forehead, cheeks, and ears.
Ocular rosacea: Involves the eyes, causing redness, burning, itching, and the sensation of a foreign body. It can lead to complications such as blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and keratitis if not treated promptly.

Clinical features
Features
typically affects nose, cheeks and forehead
flushing is often first symptom
telangiectasia are common
later develops into persistent erythema with papules and pustules
rhinophyma
ocular involvement: blepharitis
sunlight may exacerbate symptoms

Investigations
Diagnosis of rosacea is primarily based on clinical presentation and exclusion of other dermatologic conditions with similar features, such as acne, seborrheic dermatitis, and lupus. There are no specific laboratory tests for rosacea, but a skin biopsy may be useful in atypical cases or to rule out other diagnoses.

Management
Management
simple measures
recommend daily application of a high-factor sunscreen
camouflage creams may help conceal redness
predominant erythema/flushing
topical brimonidine gel may be considered for patients with predominant flushing but limited telangiectasia
CKS
brimonidine is a topical alpha-adrenergic agonist
this can be used on an 'as required basis' to temporarily reduce redness
it typically reduces redness within 30 minutes, reaching peak action at 3-6 hours, after which the redness returns to the baseline
mild-to-moderate papules and/or pustules
topical ivermectin is first-line
CKS
alternatives include: topical
metronidazole
or topical azelaic acid
moderate-to-severe papules and/or pustules
combination of topical ivermectin +  oral
doxycycline
CKS
Referral should be considered if
CKS
symptoms have not improved with optimal management in primary care
laser therapy may be appropriate for patients with prominent telangiectasia
patients with a rhinophyma
