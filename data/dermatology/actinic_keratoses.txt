Actinic keratoses
Actinic keratoses
Actinic keratoses (AKs) represent dysplastic epidermal lesions, often considered precursors to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). They arise due to chronic ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure and are characterised by rough, scaly patches or papules on sun-exposed skin, predominantly in fair-skinned, elderly individuals. While some AKs may regress spontaneously, a subset can progress to invasive SCC, necessitating prompt intervention. Histologically, AKs demonstrate atypical keratinocytes confined to the lower third of the epidermis (corresponding to in-situ SCC when full-thickness). Therapeutic strategies range from topical agents (5-fluorouracil, imiquimod), photodynamic therapy, to physical treatments (cryotherapy, curettage). Selection depends on factors such as lesion characteristics, patient preference, and practitioner expertise. In addition to treating manifest AKs, it's crucial to promote sun protective measures to prevent new lesions.

Clinical features
Features
small, crusty or scaly, lesions
may be  pink, red, brown or the same colour as the skin
typically on sun-exposed areas e.g. temples of head
multiple lesions may be present
Improve
Management
Management options include
prevention of further risk: e.g. sun avoidance, sun cream
fluorouracil cream: typically a 2 to 3 week course. The skin will become red and inflamed - sometimes topical hydrocortisone is given following fluorouracil to help settle the inflammation
topical diclofenac: may be used for mild AKs. Moderate efficacy but much fewer side-effects
topical imiquimod: trials have shown good efficacy
cryotherapy
curettage and cautery
