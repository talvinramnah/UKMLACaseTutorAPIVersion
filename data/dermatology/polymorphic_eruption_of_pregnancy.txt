Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy
Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, also known as pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy, is a benign, self-limited inflammatory dermatosis that typically affects primigravida women during the third trimester or immediate postpartum period.
Clinically, PEP presents as erythematous papules and urticarial plaques initially localized to the striae gravidarum on the abdomen and later spreading to the buttocks, thighs, and occasionally upper extremities. Lesions are pruritic but spare the periumbilical region, face, and mucosal surfaces. Systemic symptoms are absent.
Management involves emollients, mild-potency topical corticosteroids for symptomatic relief of
pruritus
and oral antihistamines for severe cases. Reassurance regarding its self-limiting nature is essential as it resolves spontaneously postpartum without sequelae or fetal complications.
