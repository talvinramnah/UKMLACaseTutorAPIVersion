Pityriasis rosea
Pityriasis rosea
Pityriasis rosea is a self-limiting, exanthematous skin disorder of unknown aetiology, commonly affecting young adults and adolescents. The condition is characterized by the acute onset of a solitary, oval-shaped herald patch, followed by the development of smaller erythematous papulosquamous lesions in a characteristic 'Christmas tree' distribution along the Langer's lines.
Pruritus
may be present and can range from mild to severe in intensity. Pityriasis rosea typically exhibits a benign clinical course, with spontaneous resolution occurring within 6-8 weeks.
The pathogenesis remains unclear; however, current evidence suggests an association with human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 and HHV-7 reactivation.
Management consists of symptomatic relief through antihistamines for pruritus control and topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors for inflammation reduction.

Aetiology
The aetiology is not fully understood but is thought that herpes hominis virus 7 (HHV-7) may play a role.

Clinical features
Features
in the majority of patients there is no prodrome, but a minority may give a history of a recent viral infection
herald patch (usually on trunk)
followed by erythematous, oval, scaly patches which follow a characteristic distribution with the longitudinal diameters of the oval lesions running parallel to the line of Langer. This may produce a 'fir-tree' appearance
Improve
Investigations
Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical presentation and history, though dermoscopy and histopathology can aid in differentiating pityriasis rosea from other dermatoses such as tinea corporis, secondary syphilis, and
guttate psoriasis
.

guttate psoriasis
and pityriasis rosea
Guttate psoriasis
Pityriasis rosea
Prodrome
Classically preceded by a streptococcal sore throat 2-4 weeks
Many patients report recent respiratory tract infections but this is not common in questions
Appearance
'Tear drop', scaly papules on the trunk and limbs
Herald patch followed 1-2 weeks later by multiple erythematous, slightly raised oval lesions with a fine scale confined to the outer aspects of the lesions.
May follow a characteristic distribution with the longitudinal diameters of the oval lesions running parallel to the line of Langer. This may produce a 'fir-tree' appearance

natural history
Most cases resolve spontaneously within 2-3 months
Topical agents as per psoriasis
UVB phototherapy
Self-limiting, resolves after around 6 weeks

Management
Reassurance and patient education:
As it is a self-limiting condition with an excellent prognosis, it is crucial to provide reassurance to patients and educate them about the natural course of the disease. Inform patients that they are not contagious and that recurrences are rare.
Symptomatic relief:
The primary goal in managing pityriasis rosea is to alleviate
pruritus
and discomfort associated with the rash. This can be achieved through various interventions:
Topical corticosteroids:
Mild-to-moderate potency topical corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone or clobetasone butyrate) can be prescribed for short-term use (<2 weeks) to reduce inflammation and itching.
Emollients:
Regular application of emollients can help maintain skin hydration and provide symptomatic relief from pruritus.
Antihistamines:
Oral antihistamines, such as cetirizine or loratadine, can be prescribed to alleviate pruritus, particularly at night.
Ultraviolet (UV) therapy:
In severe or persistent cases of PR, narrowband UVB phototherapy may be considered as an adjunct treatment. This modality has been shown to expedite resolution of the rash and provide symptomatic relief.

Complications
While complications are rare, potential sequelae include post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, particularly in patients with darker skin tones. Additionally, pityriasis rosea has been reported to occur during pregnancy and may be associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm labour or low birth weight. However, further research is needed to establish the causality between pityriasis rosea and these obstetric complications.
