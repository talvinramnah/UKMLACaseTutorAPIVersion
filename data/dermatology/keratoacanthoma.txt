Keratoacanthoma
Keratoacanthoma
Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing, self-resolving, low-grade cutaneous tumour, often mistaken for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) due to similar clinical and histological features. Aetiology is attributed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, immunosuppression, and certain genodermatoses like Ferguson-Smith syndrome. Classic presentation includes a solitary, dome-shaped nodule with central keratin-filled crater, predominantly on sun-exposed sites in elderly, fair-skinned individuals. Histologically, keratoacanthoma is characterised by a well-circumscribed, symmetrical lesion with a central keratin plug and crateriform architecture. The surrounding epithelium exhibits 'buttress' pattern, often a distinguishing feature from SCC. However, given its SCC-mimicking nature, histopathological assessment is essential to exclude invasive malignancy. Options for treatment encompass conservative monitoring (due to its self-resolving nature), surgical excision, curettage, cryotherapy, and topical chemotherapeutic agents. Even though spontaneous regression is expected, vigilance for potential malignant transformation is recommended.

Clinical features
Keratoacanthoma (KA) often presents as a rapidly-growing, dome-shaped cutaneous lesion with a central keratin plug. Typically, the lesion is solitary and evolves over weeks to months, eventually stabilising and sometimes regressing spontaneously. A hallmark of KA is its rapid growth, followed by a plateau phase, and potentially a resolution phase.
Location
Keratoacanthomas are most commonly found on sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and extremities, although they may also occur on mucous membranes. In a proportion of patients, local trauma or scarring is implicated in the lesion's onset.
Size and Shape
The lesion usually ranges from 1 cm to 2.5 cm in diameter. The symmetry is generally well maintained, lending a rather benign appearance. The nodule or papule is often flesh-coloured to erythematous, surrounded by a wall of inflamed tissue, with a central, keratin-filled crater.
Other Features
Texture: The surface of the lesion is often smooth, although crust or scale may be present.
Pain: Usually asymptomatic, but may be tender or painful depending on the lesion's size and location.
Ulceration: Although uncommon, some KAs may present with a superficial ulcerated surface.
Multiplicity: While KAs are typically solitary, multiple lesions may be present in syndromic forms such as Ferguson-Smith syndrome or Muir-Torre syndrome.

Management
Spontaneous regression of keratoacanthoma within 3 months is common, often resulting in a scar. Such lesions should however be urgently excised as it is difficult clinically to exclude squamous cell carcinoma. Removal also may prevent scarring.
