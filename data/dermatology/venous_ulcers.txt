Venous ulcers
Venous ulcers
Venous ulcers, also known as venous leg ulcers or stasis ulcers, are chronic wounds that occur primarily in the lower limbs due to impaired venous return, resulting in increased venous pressure and subsequent skin breakdown.

Aetiology
The primary aetiological factor in venous ulcer development is chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). This condition occurs when the valves in the leg veins malfunction, leading to venous hypertension. Prolonged venous hypertension results in increased capillary pressure, causing fluid and blood cells to leak into the interstitial space. This leads to local hypoxia, inflammation, and ultimately, skin and subcutaneous tissue damage, resulting in ulceration.
Other contributing factors can include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), obesity, immobility, advanced age, and a history of leg injury or previous venous ulcers.

Clinical features
Venous ulcers typically occur in the gaiter area of the leg (from the ankle to the mid-calf), above the medial malleolus. They present as irregular, shallow wounds with a granulating base and are often accompanied by substantial exudate. The surrounding skin may show signs of chronic venous insufficiency, including oedema, pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis (hardening and discolouration of the skin), and atrophie blanche (small, white scars surrounded by dilated capillaries).
Venous ulcers can be painful, but the degree of pain is usually less severe than that associated with arterial ulcers.

Investigations
Ankle-brachial pressure index
ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is important in non-healing ulcers to assess for poor arterial flow which could impair healing
a 'normal' ABPI may be regarded as between 0.9 - 1.2. Values below 0.9 indicate arterial disease. Interestingly, values above 1.3 may also indicate arterial disease, in the form of false-negative results secondary to arterial calcification (e.g. In diabetics)
Doppler ultrasound examination is often used to assess the venous system's competence and exclude arterial disease, particularly if the patient is to be considered for compression therapy.
If the ulcer does not respond to standard treatment, or if malignancy is suspected, a biopsy may be performed.

Management
The mainstay of treatment for venous ulcers is compression therapy, which improves venous return and reduces oedema. This is typically achieved with multilayer bandages or compression stockings.
Wound care, involving regular cleaning and dressing of the ulcer, is also crucial. Topical agents may be used to control bacterial overgrowth and promote wound healing. In some cases, debridement may be required.
Systemic treatment can include analgesics for pain control and, if indicated, antibiotics for cellulitis. In patients with recurrent or non-healing ulcers, surgical interventions such as endovenous ablation, sclerotherapy, or venous valve repair may be considered.
