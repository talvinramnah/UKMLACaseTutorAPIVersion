Pemphigoid gestationis
Pemphigoid gestationis
Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects pregnant women. It is characterized by the development of itchy, blistering skin lesions that typically start on the abdomen and spread to other parts of the body. The condition usually occurs in the second or third trimester of pregnancy but can also develop in the postpartum period.
The exact cause of pemphigoid gestation isis unknown, but it is thought to be related to an immune response triggered by the developing fetus. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and confirmed with skin biopsy and blood tests.
Treatment options include topical and systemic corticosteroids.

Clinical features
The initial presentation of pemphigoid gestation usually occurs between 13-40 weeks of gestation, with a majority of cases arising during the second or third trimester. However, approximately 10% of cases may present in the immediate postpartum period. The disease course tends to resolve spontaneously within weeks to months following delivery but may recur in subsequent pregnancies or during menstruation.
Cutaneous Manifestations
Pemphigoid gestation initially presents as pruritic erythematous macules, papules, and urticarial plaques on the abdomen, particularly around the umbilical region. Lesions may then spread centrifugally to involve other areas such as the trunk, extremities, buttocks, and less commonly, the face and scalp.
As the disease progresses, tense vesicles and bullae develop on both lesional and non-lesional skin over a period of days to weeks. These blisters are typically filled with clear fluid or serosanguinous exudate and can rupture easily upon pressure or trauma.
Mucosal Involvement
Mucosal involvement is relatively uncommon in pemphigoid gestation compared to other autoimmune blistering diseases like pemphigus vulgaris or mucous membrane pemphigoid. When present, oral mucosa is most frequently affected; however, lesions can also involve conjunctiva, nasal cavity, oesophagus, larynx, and genital mucosa.
Atypical Presentations
In some cases, pemphigoid gestation may present with atypical features, such as erythema multiforme-like or targetoid lesions, annular erythematous plaques mimicking urticaria or eczema, or vesicles on an erythematous base resembling herpes gestationis.
Extracutaneous Manifestations
Although primarily a cutaneous disorder, pemphigoid gestation has been associated with several extracutaneous manifestations. These include increased risk of preterm labour, small-for-gestational-age infants, and transient neonatal blistering in approximately 10% of affected pregnancies due to passive transfer of maternal autoantibodies across the placenta.
Disease Course and Prognosis
The severity of pemphigoid gestation varies from mild to severe disease but generally follows a fluctuating course with periods of exacerbation and remission. Symptoms may worsen during the third trimester and improve postpartum before resolving completely within weeks to months following delivery.
However, in some cases, the disease may persist for several months to years after delivery or recur in subsequent pregnancies. Additionally, there is an increased risk of developing other autoimmune diseases such as Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis in patients with a history of pemphigoid gestation.
