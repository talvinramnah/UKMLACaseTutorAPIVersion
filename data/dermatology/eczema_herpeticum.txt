Eczema herpeticum
Eczema herpeticum
Eczema herpeticum
is a potentially serious widespread herpes simplex virus infection, which typically affects people with atopic dermatitis or eczema but may also affect those with other inflammatory skin conditions. It typically presents in children, as an eruption of punched out ulcers most commonly affecting the head, face, neck, and trunk at sites of atopic dermatitis.
If eczema herpeticum is not diagnosed promptly, the child's condition can deteriorate rapidly and may lead to encephalitis, blindness or even multi-organ failure. A fatality rate of up to 6-10% has been estimated.

Aetiology
Atopic dermatitis
is a chronic, pruritic, eczematous skin condition that affects approximately 15% to 20% of children in developed countries.
Eczema herpeticum
is a secondary viral infection caused by HSV-1 or -2 that concomitantly occurs with skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. It typically presents in childhood but can affect patients of any age.
Less than 3% of patients with atopic dermatitis will develop eczema herpeticum
Males and females are equally affected
Can affect all ages but most common in infants and children
Risk factors include:
Early-onset or more severe atopic dermatitis
Head and neck or large body surface area involved dermatitis
High total serum IgE/ peripheral eosinophilia
Atopic comorbidities such as asthma and food allergies
History of
Staphylococcus aureus
skin infection
Other associations include younger age and non-white ethnicity, particularly African American and Asian.
It can also be triggered by
trauma or cosmetic procedures
e.g. lasers, skin peels, dermabrasion.

Pathophysiology
Most cases of eczema herpeticum arise during the first episode of infection with
Herpes simplex
(HSV) Type 1 or 2 (majority HSV-1).
HSV is a member of the double-stranded DNA Herpesviridae family.
Spread is through direct contact between a person actively shedding the virus from the oral mucosa or with bodily fluids containing the mucosa
Shedding may occur during the primary infection, during subsequent recurrences and during periods of asymptomatic viral shedding
Asymptomatic shedding in the saliva occurs in up to 25% of patients with evidence of HSV-1 infection
Eczema herpeticum may also complicate recurrent herpes.
Infection with HSV-1 begins with an acute phase:
The virus rapidly replicates at the site of contact in dermal keratinocytes and other epithelial sites
Interaction with HSV-1 surface glycoproteins and cellular HSV receptors result in the virus entering the cells
The virus then enters the sensory nerve ending and is retrogradely transported to the sensory ganglia
The preponderance for infection is multifactorial:
Atopic dermatitis results in impaired skin protective function, allowing easier infection of HSV
Disruption of the epidermal barrier is the most important risk factor
Inflammation and immune dysregulation may allow for widespread infection of the virus
HSV requires intact cellular immunity to be contained
Improve
Clinical features
Clinical features will appear 5-12 days after contact with an infected individual, who may or may not visible cold sores.
Areas of rapidly
worsening, painful eczema
Vesicular rash
Blisters may be filled with clear yellow fluid, thick purulent material or blood stained
Punched-out erosions
(circular, depressed, ulcerated lesions) usually 1-3mm that are uniform in appearance (
monomorphic
)
Initially form over areas affected by atopic dermatitis but spreads to involve normal skin over 1-2 weeks
These may coalesce to form larger areas of erosion with crusting
Typically the lesions will heal over 2-6 weeks
Possible
fever
, lethargy,
lymphadenopathy
or distress
Clinicians should be aware of
'eczema herpeticum incognito'
, a presentation that is easily mistaken for
impetigo
and most often seen in patients with severe atopic dermatitis and recurrent eczema herpeticum.
Rarely, HSV may spread to the eye resulting in
herpes keratitis
. Up to 50% of patients with herpetic blepharoconjunctivitis also have a corneal infection which can lead to scarring and if suspected should lead to a prompt ophthalmological referral. The symptoms include:
Redness
Pain
Foreign body sensation
Photophobia
Tearing
Decreased visual acuity
Improve
Investigations
In any cases where eczema herpeticum is suspected:
Referral to a specialist paediatric dermatologist
Eczema herpeticum involving the skin around the eyes should be referred for same-day ophthalmology review
Viral infection can be confirmed by viral swabs sent for:
PCR
Viral culture
Direct fluorescent antibody stain
If
impetigo
is suspected, a positive skin surface bacterial culture for
Staphylococcus
or
Streptococcus
does not exclude eczema herpeticum and is a common finding.
If herpetic keratitis is suspected:
Staining with
fluorescein
A stained dendritic ulcer is diagnostic
Improve
Differential diagnosis
Differentials of eczema herpeticum include:
Impetigo
Similarities: erosions and vesicles may be present with crusting
Differences: honey coloured crusting, no 'punched out' ulcers
Eczema vaccinatum
A rare complication of the smallpox vaccine (1 in 150,000) that occurs in people with atopic dermatitis and lead to an extensive rash and systemic illness
Similarities: papules, vesicles and umbilicated pustules or erosions at the site of active dermatitis,
fever
, malaise,
lymphadenopathy
Differences: recent history of smallpox vaccine or contact with an individual who has received the vaccine recently, no 'punched out' ulcers
Primary varicella infection
(
chickenpox
)
Similarities: papules, vesicular and eroded lesions
Differences: pruritis, no 'punched out' ulcers
Other differentials to consider: cellulitis, eczema coxsackium, eczema molluscatum, pustular psoriasis, vasculitis, scabies
Improve
Management
Eczema herpeticum is considered a dermatological emergency.
Prompt treatment with antiviral medication should eliminate the need for hospital admission:
(1)
Oral aciclovir
5 times daily for 10-14 days
Alternative: valaciclovir twice daily for 10-14 days
(2) If patient vomiting or unable to take tablets:
IV aciclovir
Management of ocular involvement involves:
Ganciclovir
ointment five times daily (3 hourly) for 7-10 days
Alternatives: trifluridine drops 1 drop nine times daily for 7-10 days followed by dose tapering
A corneal transplant may be indicated in cases of postherpetic scarring that significantly affects vision
Close monitoring after the resolution of an episode of eczema herpeticum is recommended - about 50% of patients experience recurrence.

Complications
Eczema herpeticum is considered to be a complication of atopic eczema.
Complications of eczema herpeticum include:
Secondary infection
Most common complication of eczema herpeticum
Staphylococcus aureus
might cause
impetigo
Streptococcal infection may cause cellulitis
Usually the complication that causes mortality
Scarring
Infection of the cornea leading to
herpetic keratitis
Keratitis in children tends to be more severe and may be bilateral and associated with multiple corneal or conjunctival dendrites
If untreated, can lead to blindness
Organ failure and dissemination
Particularly, the brain, lungs and liver
May result in septic shock, meningitis, encephalitis
The mortality rate is reported to be as high as 6-10%.
