Acne vulgaris
Acne vulgaris
Acne
vulgaris
is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis notable for open or closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and inflammatory lesions, including papules, pustules, or nodules. The pathogenesis involves increased sebum production, follicular hyperproliferation and inflammation triggered by
Propionibacterium acnes
. Hormonal factors play a significant role, particularly the increase in circulating androgens during puberty.
The disease primarily affects areas with the highest density of sebaceous glands: face, chest and back. Clinically, it can range from mild comedonal to severe nodulocystic acne which may lead to scarring. Psychosocial implications such as depression and anxiety are often associated with more severe presentations.
Treatment strategies include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical or oral antibiotics aiming at reducing inflammation and bacterial count. In severe cases or when first-line treatments fail, systemic isotretinoin may be considered.

Aetiology
Genetics: A positive family history of
acne
has been consistently associated with a higher risk of developing the condition, suggesting a genetic predisposition.
Hormonal factors: Androgens, such as testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), play a crucial role in the development of acne by stimulating sebaceous gland activity and sebum production.
Age: Adolescence is a peak period for acne development due to increased hormone production during puberty.
Environmental factors: External factors, including diet, stress, and exposure to pollutants, may contribute to the onset and exacerbation of acne.

Pathophysiology
Acne
vulgaris, a prevalent dermatological disorder, is characterised by the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules and cysts. Its pathophysiology involves the interplay of four key elements: increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinisation,
Propionibacterium acnes
(P. acnes) colonisation and inflammation.
Increase in Sebum Production:
The process begins with an increase in sebum production which is primarily driven by hormonal changes, particularly an increase in androgens such as testosterone. These hormones stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more sebum.
Increased sebum provides a lipid-rich environment that favours the proliferation of skin microorganisms and leads to follicular occlusion.
Follicular Hyperkeratinisation:
This occlusion is further exacerbated by abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation within the pilosebaceous unit leading to follicular hyperkeratinisation.
This results in the formation of a keratinous plug known as a microcomedo - the precursor lesion for all acne lesions.
Colonisation with
P. acnes:
The lipid-rich environment created by increased sebum production also promotes overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria like
P. acnes
.
P. acnes
metabolises sebum triglycerides into free fatty acids which act as chemotactic factors attracting neutrophils and monocytes thereby initiating an inflammatory response.
Inflammation:
The immune system responds to
P. acnes
by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha.
This response leads to inflammation, erythema and the formation of inflammatory lesions including papules, pustules, nodules and cysts.
Clinical manifestations
Comedone Formation
The combination of hyperkeratinisation and increased sebum results in non-inflammatory lesions known as comedones. Closed comedones (whiteheads) occur when the follicular opening is obstructed completely; open comedones (blackheads) form when there is partial obstruction with exposure to air causing oxidation of melanin or lipids within the sebum.
Papule and Pustule Development
If inflammation persists around a blocked follicle, it can evolve into papulesâ€”small raised bumps indicating underlying inflammation without pus formation.
Pustules form when there is visible accumulation of pus due to intense infiltration by neutrophils responding to bacterial antigens and cellular debris within the follicle.
Nodule and Cyst Formation
Severe inflammatory responses lead to deeper lesions termed nodules or cysts. These are characterised by significant infiltration by macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells, along with extensive tissue destruction resulting in fibrosis if not properly managed.
Nodules are firm lumps beneath the surface while cysts may be fluctuant due to liquefied necrotic material encapsulated within fibrous tissue.

Clinical features
Acne
is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Several different types of acne lesions are usually seen in each patient
Comedones are due to a dilated sebaceous follicle
if the top is closed a whitehead is seen
if the top opens a blackhead forms
Inflammatory lesions form when the follicle bursts releasing irritants
papules
pustules
An excessive inflammatory response may result in:
nodules
cysts
This sequence of events can ultimately cause scarring
ice-pick scars
hypertrophic scars
In contrast,
drug-induced acne
is often monomorphic (e.g. pustules are characteristically seen in steroid use)
Acne fulminans
is very severe acne associated with systemic upset (e.g. fever). Hospital admission is often required and the condition usually responds to oral steroids

Differential diagnosis
Acne
vulgaris is a common dermatological condition that can often be confused with other skin conditions due to similar presentations. Three such conditions include Rosacea, Folliculitis and
Perioral Dermatitis
.
Rosacea
Rosacea presents as erythema, telangiectasia, papules and pustules primarily on the central face (forehead, nose, cheeks and chin). Key differences in clinical presentation between acne vulgaris and rosacea include:
No comedones are present in rosacea which are characteristic of acne vulgaris.
Rosacea often includes symptoms of flushing and ocular involvement which are not seen in acne vulgaris.
The absence of scarring is more typical for rosacea whereas acne vulgaris may lead to scarring if severe or left untreated.
Folliculitis
Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles caused by bacterial infection, most commonly
Staphylococcus aureus
. It can mimic acne vulgaris but there are several distinguishing characteristics:
Folliculitis lesions tend to have a more uniform appearance than those of acne vulgaris.
The distribution of folliculitis can occur anywhere there is hair growth and is not limited to the face, chest and back as with acne vulgaris.
The presence of pruritus (itching) is more common in folliculitis than in acne vulgaris.
Perioral Dermatitis
Perioral dermatitis presents as small papules and pustules around the mouth area. This condition can be mistaken for acne vulgaris due to similar lesion types; however, it differs in several ways:
Perioral dermatitis is limited to the perioral area (around the mouth), periocular area (around the eyes) or nasolabial folds, whereas acne vulgaris commonly affects the face, chest and back.
Perioral dermatitis does not present with comedones which are a hallmark sign of acne vulgaris.
The skin around the lesions in perioral dermatitis may appear scaly or dry, unlike acne vulgaris.

Management
Acne
vulgaris is a common skin disorder which usually occurs in adolescence. It typically affects the face, neck and upper trunk and is characterised by the obstruction of the pilosebaceous follicles with keratin plugs which results in comedones, inflammation and pustules.
Acne may be classified into mild, moderate or severe:
mild: open and closed comedones with or without sparse inflammatory lesions
moderate acne: widespread non-inflammatory lesions and numerous papules and pustules
severe acne: extensive inflammatory lesions, which may include nodules, pitting, and scarring
For people with mild to moderate acne:
CKS
a 12-week course of topical combination therapy should be tried first-line:
a fixed combination of topical adapalene with topical benzoyl peroxide
a fixed combination of topical tretinoin with topical clindamycin
a fixed combination of topical benzoyl peroxide with topical clindamycin
topical benzoyl peroxide may be used as monotherapy if these options are contraindicated or the person wishes to avoid using a topical retinoid or an antibiotic
For people with moderate to severe acne:
CKS
a 12-week course of one of the following options:
a fixed combination of topical adapalene with topical benzoyl peroxide
a fixed combination of topical tretinoin with topical clindamycin
a fixed combination of topical adapalene with topical benzoyl peroxide + either oral lymecycline or oral doxycycline
a topical azelaic acid + either oral lymecycline or oral doxycycline
important points about oral antibiotic usage:
tetracyclines
should be avoided in pregnant or breastfeeding women and in children younger than 12 years of age. Erythromycin may be used in pregnancy
minocycline is now considered less appropriate due to the possibility of irreversible pigmentation
only continue a treatment option that includes an antibiotic (topical or oral) for more than 6 months in exceptional circumstances
a topical retinoid (if not contraindicated) or benzoyl peroxide should always be co-prescribed with oral antibiotics to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance developing. Topical and oral antibiotics should not be used in combination
Gram-negative folliculitis may occur as a complication of long-term antibiotic use - high-dose oral trimethoprim is effective if this occurs
combined oral contraceptives (COCP) are an alternative to oral antibiotics in women
as with antibiotics, they should be used in combination with topical agents
Dianette (co-cyprindiol) is sometimes used as it has anti-androgen properties. However, it has an increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared to other COCPs, therefore it should generally be used second-line, only be given for 3 months and women should be appropriately counselled about the risks
oral isotretinoin: only under specialist supervision
pregnancy is a contraindication to topical and oral retinoid treatment
To reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance developing the following should not be used to treat acne:
CKS
monotherapy with a topical antibiotic
monotherapy with an oral antibiotic
a combination of a topical antibiotic and an oral antibiotic
NICE referral criteria
CKS
the following patients should be referred to a dermatologist:
patients with acne conglobate acne: a rare and severe form of acne found mostly in men that presents with extensive inflammatory papules, suppurative nodules (that may coalesce to form sinuses) and cysts on the trunk.
patients with nodulo-cystic acne
referral should be
considered
in the following scenarios:
mild to moderate acne has not responded to two completed courses of treatment
moderate to severe acne has not responded to previous treatment that includes an oral antibiotic
acne with scarring
acne with persistent pigmentary changes
acne is causing or contributing to persistent psychological distress or a mental health disorder

Complications
Complications of
acne
vulgaris can be both physical and psychological, significantly impacting patients' quality of life.
Physical complications
Scarring:
Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and atrophic or hypertrophic scarring are common in moderate to severe acne. Scarring is often permanent, leading to significant cosmetic concern.
Nodulocystic lesions:
Severe forms of acne may result in large, painful nodules or cysts which are prone to rupture and may cause extensive scarring.
Secondary infection:
Acne lesions can become secondarily infected by bacteria such as
Staphylococcus aureus
, potentially leading to cellulitis or abscess formation.
Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH):
This occurs due to melanocyte stimulation during the healing process, more prevalent in individuals with darker skin types.
Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE):
Persistent redness following inflammation is common in lighter skin types.
Psychological complications
Anxiety and depression:
The appearance of acne can lead to significant emotional distress, contributing to anxiety disorders and depression. This is especially prevalent among adolescents.
Social withdrawal:
Patients with acne often experience social withdrawal due to embarrassment about their appearance. This can lead to isolation and decreased quality of life.
Suicidal ideation:
In severe cases, the psychological distress caused by acne has been linked with suicidal ideation.
Treatment should aim not only at clearing the skin lesions but also addressing these potential complications. Early intervention is key in preventing irreversible physical damage and mitigating psychological impact.
Treatment-related complications
Antibiotic resistance:
Long-term use of topical or oral antibiotics for acne treatment can lead to antibiotic resistance, making future infections more difficult to treat.
Tetracycline staining:
Tetracyclines
, commonly used in acne treatment, can cause permanent teeth discolouration if used in children under 8 years of age or in pregnant women.
Isotretinoin side effects:
Isotretinoin, a potent oral retinoid used for severe acne, can cause numerous side effects including teratogenicity, hyperlipidaemia and hepatotoxicity. Regular monitoring is required during treatment.
