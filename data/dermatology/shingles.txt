Aetiology
Shingles is caused by re-activation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a double-stranded DNA herpes virus. It is only possible to develop shingles if a person has been previously infected with VZV, otherwise known as chickenpox, which tends to occur in childhood. The VZV is spread via air droplets.
After initial infection with VZV, the virus lays dormant in the dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia, causing no clinical symptoms. It remains silent and unnoticed in these nerves for many years, often until late adulthood, before re-activating and causing shingles. It is unknown what exactly causes the virus to re-activate, however there are some known triggers:
Emotional stress
Immunosuppression
Chemotherapy
High dose steroid therapy
Recent illness or surgery
Skin injury
Sunburn
Trauma)
However, in majority of people who develop shingles, there is no identifiable cause or trigger.
As the VZV affects the dorsal and/or cranial nerve ganglia, the sensory nerves are what are affected in the course of the disease, hence the characteristic single dermatome distribution. The virus continues to multiply and move along the affected sensory nerve, eventually reaching the skin. The continuing inflammation and destruction of the sensory nerves leads to the characteristic shingles rash and neuropathic pain.

Clinical features
Shingles characteristically presents in three phases; the prodromal phase, the infectious rash, and the resolution phase.
Prodrome
Acute neuralgia (70-80% of patients)
Tingling, burning, itching or occasionally stabbing in nature
Non-specific symptoms such as
malaise
,
fatigue
, headache (approximately <20% of patients)
Enlarged lymph nodes in region of affected area
Typically 2-3 days long, may last up to a week
Infectious phase
Rash
Usually affecting a single dermatome in a band-like distribution
Unilateral, rarely crossing the midline
Initially is erythematous and macular in nature
Progression to erythematous papules, and eventually vesicles or bullae by day 7
Vesicles become pustular or haemorrhagic near the end of this phase, right before crusting over
Pain
Often, pain will be located around the region where the rash is located
Very rarely, the rash is painless (typically this occurs in children)
Lasts approximately 7-10 days
Resolution phase
The vesicular rash crusts over within 10-12 days of rash onset
The crusted lesions can take up to one month to completely disappear
Improve
Differential diagnosis
Usually shingles is diagnosed clinically due to its characteristic presentation; prodromal pain phase, and then eruption of a painful, vesicular, unilateral rash. However, other important differential diagnoses should be considered, particularly because an atypical presentation of shingles is common.
Possible differential diagnoses
Herpes simplex virus
Similarities
: may be recurrent, individual lesions appear similar (vesicular, erythematous, ulcers)
Differences
: shingles appears in dermatomal band-like distribution, herpes simplex virus appears in clusters
Impetigo
Similarities
: initially both appear as erythematous sores which become blisters and then burst
Differences
: usually painless and itchy, more common in school aged children, more common around nose and mouth
Dermatitis herpetiformis
Similarities
: both appear as small, clustered papules and vesicles
Differences
: dermatitis herpetiformis is symmetrical and bilateral (commonly affecting the elbows, knees, buttocks, back or scalp), exists in patients alongside gluten-sensitive enteropathies
Drug eruptions
Similarities
: similar rash appearance (can be erythematous small lesions, blisters, or vesicles)
Differences
: causative agent (often antibiotics, NSAIDs, anti-epileptic drugs), usually symmetrical and bilateral
Contact dermatitis
Similarities
: rash appearance can be similar (erythematous, blistering, crusting)
Differences
: usually a distinguishable cause (e.g. new clothing, metals, drugs, creams, latex), typically not painful, can be severely itchy

Management
Most commonly, the management of shingles is supportive, as the infections are typically self-limiting.
Supportive management
Analgesia
NICE recommend beginning with common mild analgesics, such as paracetamol alone or in combination with codeine or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen
In cases of moderate-severe pain, NICE recommend addition of either amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin or pregabalin, chosen based on side-effect profile and co-morbidities
BMJ best practice suggest that calamine lotion application to affected skin can provide relief to both pain and pruritis, if present
Topical capsaicin can be considered and can provide some pain relief
Cool compresses on affected area a few times a day
Anti-viral therapy
NICE recommend prescription of an oral antiviral within 72 hours of rash onset if:
Immunocompromised patients
Non-truncal rash involvement (e.g. affecting face, neck, limbs, perineum)
Moderate-severe pain or rash
Consider prescribing anti-viral therapy if aged >50-years-old (NICE suggest this is with the aim to reduce the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia)
Oral aciclovir, famciclovir, or valaciclovir
Most benefit if treatment started <72 hours after onset of rash
NICE recommend that if it is
not
possible to start within 72 hours, it can still be considered up to one week after onset of the rash
Intravenous can be considered, only if oral therapy is not tolerated
Corticosteroids
If a patient is on anti-viral treatment, NICE further recommend consideration of a course of oral corticosteroids
Used in the first 2 weeks following the onset of the rash
This should only be used in conjunction with anti-viral treatment, and in immunocompetent adults with localised shingles if the pain is severe
Post-herpetic neuralgia
As the most common complication of shingles, post-herpetic neuralgia must be treated effectively to reduce the debilitating consequences
Begin with mild analgesics (NSAIDs +/- paracetamol)
Opioid analgesics can be added if mild pain relief is not sufficient
As the pain is neuropathic in nature, it may respond to a tricyclic anti-depressant or anti-convulsant
Specialist advice
NICE guidelines recommend that specialist advice should be sought, or people should be admitted to hospital if:
Serious complications
Herpes zoster ophthalmicus
or eye involvement
Immunocompromised people
Prevention
A vaccination against herpes zoster is available for adults over the age of 50-years-old as primary prevention
Not usually used in those aged 50-69 years old, but NICE suggest offering the vaccine to people who are not eligible for the national program
if
they would benefit due to underlying conditions that may predispose them to shingles infection
NICE recommend the shingles vaccine should be offered to people if:
Aged >70-years-old, on or after their 70th birthday
Aged >78-years-old, on or after their 78th birthday
Eligible for vaccination in the previous immunisation programme but have not been vaccinated yet
Given as a single subcutaneous dose
Contraindicated in immunocompromised people, pregnant women, and children, as it is a live vaccination
Improve
Complications
Post-herpetic neuralgia
Most common complication of shingles
Persistent pain in region of rash, even after rash and acute illness is resolved (lasting >1 month)
Burning, shooting or tingling pain
Hyperalgesia or allodynia over region affected
Increased risk
Older age (affects >33% of patients over 40-years-old)
Greater severity of rash in acute infectious phase
Herpes zoster ophthalmicus
Occurs when shingles involves the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve 5), specifically the ophthalmic branch
May result in irreversible vision loss and cranial nerve 5 palsy
If present, requires urgent referral to ophthalmology
Ramsay-Hunt syndrome
Occurs if shingles affects the facial nerve (cranial nerve 7)
Clinical features:
Vesicular lesions in ear
Facial and/or tongue paralysis
Encephalitis
Rare complication that may occur 3-4 days after the rash onset
Patients at increased risk
Immunocompromised
Shingles in cranial nerve dermatome
Clinical features:
Delirium (confusion, restlessness, hallucinations, drowsiness)
Headache
Fever
Seizures

Screening and prevention
The 'shingles vaccine'
In 2013 the NHS introduced a vaccine to boost the immunity of elderly people against herpes zoster. Some important points about the vaccine:
offered to all patients aged 70-79 years*
is
live-attenuated
and given
sub-cutaneously
As it is a live-attenuated vaccine the main contraindications are immunosuppression.
Side-effects
injection site reactions
less than 1 in 10,000 individuals will develop chickenpox
