Pyoderma gangrenosum
Pyoderma gangrenosum
Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, non-infectious, inflammatory disorder. It is an uncommon cause of very painful skin ulceration. It may affect any part of the skin, but the lower legs are the most common site.

Pathophysiology
Pyoderma gangrenosum is classified as a neutrophilic dermatosis. Neutrophilic dermatoses are skin conditions characterised by dense infiltration of neutrophils in the affected tissue and this is often seen on biopsy.
The exact pathogenesis is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve an aberrant neutrophilic response and dysregulation of the immune system. The role of genetic factors and the influence of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-Î±, have been suggested.

Clinical features
Features
location
typically on the lower limb
soften at the site of a minor injury as in this patient's case and this is known as pathergy
initially features:
usually starts quite suddenly
small pustule, red bump or blood-blister
later features:
the skin then breaks down resulting in an ulcer which is often painful
the edge of the ulcer is often described as purple, violaceous and undermined.
the ulcer itself may be deep and necrotic
may be accompanied by systemic symptoms
fever
myalgia
Improve
Investigations
Diagnosis
often made by the characteristic appearance, associations with other diseases, the presence of pathergy, histology results and when other diseases have been ruled out
histology is not specific and can vary depending on the time and site of the specimen but may be helpful in ruling out other causes of an ulcer.

Management
Management
the potential for rapid progression is high in most patients and most doctors advocate oral steroids as first-line treatment
other immunosuppressive therapy, for example, ciclosporin and infliximab, have a role in difficult cases
any surgery should be postponed until the disease process is controlled on immunosuppression to risk worsening of the disease (pathergy)
