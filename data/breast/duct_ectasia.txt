Duct ectasia
Duct ectasia
Duct ectasia, also known as mammary duct ectasia or periductal mastitis, is a benign breast condition characterized by the dilation and thickening of the subareolar ducts. The condition is more commonly observed in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, but can also occur in younger women and, rarely, in men.

Aetiology
The exact cause of duct ectasia remains unclear, but several factors have been proposed, including:
Involution: Age-related changes in breast tissue may lead to ductal dilation and thickening.
Inflammation: Chronic inflammation of the ducts may contribute to duct ectasia.
Smoking: Cigarette smoking has been associated with an increased risk of duct ectasia.

Clinical features
Patients with duct ectasia may present with a variety of symptoms, including:
Nipple discharge
: The discharge can be serous, serosanguineous, or green-black in colour, and is often thick and sticky.
Nipple inversion or retraction: This occurs due to fibrosis of the periductal tissue.
Subareolar mass: A palpable, non-tender mass may be present in the subareolar region.
Mastalgia: Pain or discomfort in the breast may be experienced by some patients.

Investigations
Imaging Studies:
These typically include mammography and ultrasound:
Mammography:
This is usually the initial imaging investigation. It can identify dilated ducts, as well as detect any suspicious areas that could suggest breast malignancy.
Ultrasound:
This imaging modality is particularly useful for evaluating the nature of any lumps found on clinical examination or mammography. It can differentiate between solid and cystic lesions and can provide further detail on ductal changes.
Nipple Discharge
Examination:
If nipple discharge is present, it may be sent for cytological analysis to look for abnormal cells.
Ductography/Galactography:
This investigation involves the injection of a contrast medium into the nipple duct followed by mammography. It can provide detailed images of the ductal system and can be particularly helpful when nipple discharge is the predominant symptom.
Biopsy:
In certain circumstances, a biopsy may be required to rule out malignancy, especially if imaging reveals suspicious findings. This can be performed using fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or vacuum-assisted biopsy techniques.

Management
The management of duct ectasia depends on the severity of the symptoms and patient preference:
Observation: In cases with minimal or no symptoms, observation and reassurance may be sufficient.
Medical treatment: Oral antibiotics may be prescribed for cases with superimposed infection. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to manage pain and inflammation.
Surgical intervention: In cases with recurrent infection, severe

, or persistent pain, surgical intervention may be considered. Options include duct excision, microdochectomy, or subareolar resection.
