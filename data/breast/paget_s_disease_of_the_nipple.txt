Paget's disease of the nipple
Paget's disease of the nipple, also known as mammary Paget's disease, is a rare form of breast cancer characterized by the presence of malignant cells within the nipple-areolar complex. This condition affects the epidermis of the nipple and areola, leading to erythema, scaling, and ulceration. Paget's disease of the nipple accounts for approximately 1-2% of all breast cancer cases and may be associated with an underlying in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma.

Pathophysiology
The exact cause of Paget's disease of the nipple remains unclear, but two primary theories have been proposed:
Epidermotropic theory: Malignant cells from an underlying ductal carcinoma migrate through lactiferous ducts and invade the epidermis of the nipple and areola.
Intraepidermal origin theory: Paget's cells arise independently within the nipple epidermis and later infiltrate the underlying breast tissue.

Clinical features
Paget's disease of the nipple typically presents as unilateral changes in the appearance and texture of the nipple and areola. Symptoms may include:
Erythema, scaling, and thickening of the skin
Itching, burning, or pain in the nipple and areola
Nipple discharge, which may be bloody or serous
Nipple inversion or retraction
Ulceration or erosions in advanced cases
Due to its nonspecific presentation, Paget's disease can be misdiagnosed as other benign skin conditions, such as eczema or dermatitis, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

Investigations
Imaging studies:
Mammography, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to evaluate the breast tissue for any underlying malignancies.
Skin biopsy:
Punch or shave biopsy of the nipple or areola is essential for histopathological confirmation of Paget's disease
The presence of Paget cells'large, round, and pale-staining cells with abundant cytoplasm and large nuclei'confirms the diagnosis.

Management
The optimal treatment plan varies depending on whether underlying invasive or in situ breast cancer is present, and the patient's individual circumstances.
Diagnosis:
Initial management involves confirmation of diagnosis through a skin biopsy of the nipple lesion. Additionally, all patients should undergo a mammogram and possibly an ultrasound of the breast and axillary lymph nodes. An MRI of the breast may be considered to further evaluate the extent of disease.
Surgery:
The mainstay of treatment for Paget's disease of the nipple is surgical. There are two primary surgical options:
Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS):
BCS, also known as a wide local excision, aims to conserve as much of the breast as possible while removing the disease. It involves the excision of the nipple-areola complex and a margin of healthy tissue. This procedure is generally preferred when there is no underlying breast carcinoma, or the carcinoma is limited to the area beneath the nipple-areola complex. BCS is typically followed by radiation therapy.
Mastectomy:
A total mastectomy involves the removal of the entire breast tissue and is generally recommended when an invasive or in situ carcinoma in the breast parenchyma is present, separate from the nipple-areola complex, or in the case of multifocal disease. Depending on the involvement of axillary lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary node dissection may be performed concurrently. Options for breast reconstruction should be discussed with the patient prior to surgery.
Radiation Therapy:
Radiation therapy is recommended following breast-conserving surgery to reduce the risk of local recurrence. It is typically not required after mastectomy, unless there is extensive disease with multiple positive lymph nodes.
Systemic Therapy:
The need for systemic therapy, such as hormonal therapy or chemotherapy, depends on the characteristics of the underlying breast cancer (if present), including the hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and the presence of lymph node or distant metastases. Patients with ER-positive tumours should be offered adjuvant hormonal therapy. HER2-positive tumours may benefit from targeted therapy with trastuzumab.
