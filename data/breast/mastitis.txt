Mastitis
Mastitis
Mastitis usually occurs in lactating women but can occasionally occur in non-lactating women. It is characterised by inflammation of the breast tissue. It can be caused by bacterial infection, blocked milk ducts, or a combination of both. Symptoms include
breast pain
, swelling, redness, and warmth, as well as
fever
and flu-like symptoms in severe cases.
Treatment involves antibiotics for bacterial infections, pain relief, and supportive measures such as frequent breastfeeding or pumping to relieve engorgement and prevent milk stasis. Complications such as abscess formation or recurrent infections may occur.
