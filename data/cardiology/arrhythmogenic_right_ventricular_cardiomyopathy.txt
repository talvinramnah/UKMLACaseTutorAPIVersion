Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC, also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or ARVD) is a form of inherited cardiovascular disease which may present with
syncope
or sudden cardiac death. It is generally regarded as the second most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young after hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Pathophysiology
Pathophysiology
inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable expression
the right ventricular myocardium is replaced by fatty and fibrofatty tissue
around 50% of patients have a mutation of one of the several genes which encode components of desmosome

Clinical features
A stereotypical presentation of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) often involves a young adult, typically between 20 to 40 years of age, presenting with symptoms such as
palpitations
,
syncope
and exertional
dyspnoea
. These symptoms are usually triggered by physical activity.
However, the clinical features of ARVC can be diverse and may vary in severity and onset. It is characterised by the following:
Cardiac Symptoms
Palpitations:
This is often the initial complaint in many patients. Palpitations are frequently associated with ventricular tachycardia.
Syncope:
Syncope or pre-syncope typically occurs during or shortly after physical activity and is a sign of life-threatening arrhythmias.
Dyspnoea:
Dyspnoea on exertion can occur due to reduced right ventricular function or from arrhythmias.
Chest pain
:
Non-anginal chest pain may be present, particularly post-exercise.
Ventricular Arrhythmias
Ventricular arrhythmias are common in ARVC. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is often seen, which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation causing sudden cardiac death. VT episodes are often exercise-induced and may cause syncope.
Heart Failure
Right-sided heart failure symptoms such as peripheral oedema, ascites and elevated jugular venous pressure may occur due to progressive loss of right ventricular function. In advanced stages, biventricular heart failure may develop.
Sudden Cardiac Death
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a feared complication of ARVC, often occurring in young individuals during strenuous physical activity. SCD may be the first manifestation of the disease.

Investigations
Investigation
ECG abnormalities in V1-3, typically T wave inversion. An epsilon wave is found in about 50% of those with ARV - this is best described as a terminal notch in the QRS complex
echo changes are often subtle in the early stages but may show an enlarged, hypokinetic right ventricle with a thin free wall
magnetic resonance imaging is useful to show fibrofatty tissue

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) must consider other conditions that can present with similar clinical features. The three most likely alternative diagnoses are dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and Brugada syndrome.
Dilated Cardiomyopathy:
This condition is characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of one or both ventricles. In contrast to ARVC, dilated cardiomyopathy usually affects the left ventricle or both ventricles, rather than predominantly the right ventricle. Clinically, patients may present with symptoms of heart failure such as
dyspnoea
, fatigue and fluid retention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings typically show left bundle branch block pattern and sinus tachycardia, which differ from the Epsilon waves or T-wave inversions in V1-V3 leads seen in ARVC.
Myocarditis:
Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium that can mimic ARVC clinically and on imaging studies. Unlike ARVC, myocarditis often has an acute onset associated with a recent viral infection. Symptoms may include
chest pain
,
palpitations
and
syncope
, similar to those seen in ARVC. However, ECG changes are more variable in myocarditis and may include ST-segment elevation or depression, T wave inversion or normal findings. Furthermore, cardiac MRI often shows late gadolinium enhancement in a non-coronary distribution pattern unlike the fibrofatty replacement seen in ARVC.
Brugada Syndrome:
This genetic disorder leads to abnormal electrical activity in the heart, increasing risk for sudden cardiac death. It shares with ARVC a propensity for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death, particularly in young patients. However, Brugada syndrome is distinguished by a characteristic ECG pattern of ST-segment elevation in V1-V3 leads with right bundle branch block appearance, which is not seen in ARVC. Additionally, unlike ARVC, structural abnormalities are typically absent in Brugada syndrome.

Management
Management of Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) involves a multi-faceted approach with consideration for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It is imperative to tailor the management plan according to the individual's clinical presentation, disease severity and risk factors.
Pharmacological Management
Beta-blockers:
These are often used as first-line therapy to reduce ventricular arrhythmias, thereby decreasing the risk of sudden cardiac death.
Antiarrhythmic drugs:
Sotalol or Amiodarone can be considered if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective. However, their use should be carefully monitored due to potential side effects.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs):
They may be beneficial in patients with left ventricular involvement or heart failure.
Non-pharmacological Management
Catheter ablation:
This can be considered in patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia despite optimal medical therapy. Ablation targets the electroanatomical substrate of ARVC.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD):
ICD implantation is recommended for secondary prevention in patients who have survived a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia. For primary prevention, it should be considered in high-risk patients such as those with
syncope
, severe right ventricle dilatation/dysfunction, or extensive left-dominant disease.
Sport restrictions:
Competitive sports and intense physical activity should be avoided due to the risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Genetic Counselling
Given the genetic nature of ARVC, family screening is essential. Genetic counselling can provide valuable information about the risk of disease transmission to offspring and guide decision-making for family members.

Complications
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is associated with several complications, prioritised based on their likelihood and severity:
Ventricular arrhythmias:
These are the most common complication of ARVC. Patients may present with
palpitations
,
syncope
or sudden cardiac death due to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
Sudden cardiac death:
ARVC is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes. It typically results from malignant ventricular arrhythmias.
Heart failure:
Over time, progressive myocardial loss and fibrofatty replacement can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Symptoms might include
dyspnoea
, fatigue and fluid retention.
Atrial arrhythmias:
Although less common than ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation or flutter can occur in patients with ARVC. These may precipitate heart failure or stroke.
Thromboembolic events:
The risk of thromboembolism increases due to atrial arrhythmias or left ventricular involvement. This could manifest as a stroke or peripheral embolism.
The management of these complications often involves a combination of medication, device therapy (like implantable cardioverter defibrillators), lifestyle changes, and in severe cases, heart transplantation.
