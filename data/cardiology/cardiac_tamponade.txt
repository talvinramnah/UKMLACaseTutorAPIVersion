Cardiac tamponade
Cardiac tamponade is characterized by the accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure.

Clinical features
Classical features - Beck's triad:
Hypotension
Raised JVP
Muffled heart sounds
Other features:
Dyspnoea
Tachycardia
An absent Y descent on the JVP - this is due to the limited right ventricular filling
Pulsus paradoxus - an abnormally large drop in BP during inspiration
Kussmaul's sign - much debate about this
ECG: electrical alternans

Differential diagnosis
When evaluating a patient with suspected cardiac tamponade, it's essential to consider other differential diagnoses that may present with similar clinical features. These include acute myocardial infarction (AMI), constrictive pericarditis, and tension pneumothorax.
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)
The presentation of AMI can be similar to cardiac tamponade as both conditions can lead to chest pain, dyspnoea and hypotension. However, in AMI the pain is often described as crushing or pressure-like and may radiate to the arm, neck or jaw. The pain typically lasts longer than 20 minutes and does not change with position or respiration.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings in AMI usually demonstrate ST-segment elevation or depression along with T-wave inversion which are generally absent in cardiac tamponade.
In contrast to cardiac tamponade where pulsus paradoxus is often present, this phenomenon is not typical in AMI.
Constrictive Pericarditis
This condition can mimic cardiac tamponade due to the presence of pericardial effusion. Both conditions can cause elevated jugular venous pressure, Kussmaul's sign, and peripheral oedema. However, constrictive pericarditis tends to have a more chronic course while cardiac tamponade is an acute event.
The hallmark of constrictive pericarditis includes a pericardial knock on auscultation and signs of right heart failure such as hepatomegaly and ascites.
An ECG might show low voltage QRS complexes due to the thickened pericardium whereas in cardiac tamponade, electrical alternans may be seen.
The key differences between constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade are summarised in the table below:

Pericardial calcification on CXR
Tension Pneumothorax
Tension pneumothorax can also present with acute chest pain, dyspnoea and hypotension similarly to cardiac tamponade. However, the onset of symptoms in tension pneumothorax is usually sudden and often associated with a traumatic event or invasive procedure.
Physical examination typically reveals decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on the affected side which are not characteristic findings in cardiac tamponade.
A chest radiograph will demonstrate a collapsed lung and mediastinal shift towards the opposite side in tension pneumothorax, while in cardiac tamponade it may show an enlarged cardiac silhouette if pericardial effusion is substantial.
