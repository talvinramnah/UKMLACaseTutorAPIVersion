De Quervain's tenosynovitis
De Quervain's tenosynovitis
De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a common condition in which the sheath containing the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus tendons is inflamed. It typically affects females aged 30 - 50 years old.

Clinical features
Features
pain on the radial side of the wrist
tenderness over the radial styloid process
abduction of the thumb against resistance is painful
Finkelstein's test: with the thumb is flexed across the palm of the hand, pain is reproduced by movement of the wrist into flexion and ulnar deviation

Management
Aims and General Approach
The primary aims of management are to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, restore function, and prevent recurrence.
Initial treatment is generally conservative, with escalation to interventional or surgical options considered for persistent or severe cases.
Management should be individualised according to symptom severity, duration, impact on daily activities, and patient preference.
Conservative Management
First-line management is non-surgical.
Advise patients to avoid aggravating activities that exacerbate symptoms (e.g. repetitive thumb movements).
Application of a thumb spica splint immobilises the affected tendons and may provide symptomatic relief.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used for pain control; topical preparations may be preferred as per
NICE guidance
.
Physiotherapy interventions such as tendon gliding exercises may be considered if symptoms persist despite initial measures.
Corticosteroid Injection and Surgical Intervention
If conservative measures fail after several weeks, corticosteroid injection into the first dorsal compartment is recommended.
This approach has demonstrated high efficacy in providing symptom relief; up to 80% of patients experience significant improvement following a single injection.
Injections should be performed using appropriate technique to minimise risk of complications (e.g. subcutaneous fat atrophy).
Surgical intervention is reserved for refractory cases where symptoms persist despite two appropriately administered corticosteroid injections and ongoing functional impairment.
Surgery involves decompression of the first dorsal compartment by releasing the overlying sheath.
Postoperative outcomes are generally excellent, with most patients regaining full function.
The majority of patients respond well to conservative or minimally invasive treatments.
Referral to hand surgery should be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty or failure of standard therapies.
