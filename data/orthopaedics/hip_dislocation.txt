Hip dislocation
Hip dislocation
Hip dislocation is an extremely painful condition that is mostly caused by direct trauma, particularly road traffic accidents and significant falls from height.  Given the large forces required to cause most traumatic hip dislocation, it may be associated with other fractures and life-threatening injuries. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of hip dislocation are important to reduce morbidity.

Classification
Types of hip dislocation
Posterior dislocation: Accounts for 90% of hip dislocations. The affected leg is shortened, adducted, and internally rotated.
Anterior dislocation: The affected leg is usually abducted and externally rotated. No leg shortening.
Central dislocation

Clinical features
Presentation and Classification
Hip dislocations can be classified into two primary categories: traumatic and atraumatic. Traumatic hip dislocations are the result of high-energy forces such as motor vehicle accidents, falls from significant heights, or sports injuries. Atraumatic hip dislocations are typically associated with underlying hip joint pathology or predisposing factors such as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) or neuromuscular disorders.
Anterior Dislocation
Subtype: Obturator
Patient presentation: Affected limb is abducted, externally rotated, and mildly flexed.
Palpation findings: Prominence of the greater trochanter laterally; femoral head palpable in the medial thigh region near the obturator foramen.
Subtype: Pubic
Patient presentation: Affected limb is abducted, externally rotated, and significantly flexed at both the hip and knee joints.
Palpation findings: Femoral head palpable in the inguinal region; lesser trochanter prominence may be appreciated posteriorly.
Posterior Dislocation
Subtype: Iliac
Patient presentation: Affected limb is adducted, internally rotated, and mildly flexed at the hip joint.
Palpation findings: Prominence of the greater trochanter posteriorly; femoral head palpable in the buttock region near the sciatic notch.
Subtype: Ischiatic
Patient presentation: Affected limb is adducted, internally rotated, and significantly flexed at both the hip and knee joints.
Palpation findings: Femoral head palpable in proximity to the ischial tuberosity; lesser trochanter prominence may be appreciated anteriorly.
Associated Injuries
It is crucial to evaluate for concomitant injuries, as hip dislocations often occur in the context of high-energy trauma. Potential associated injuries to consider include:
Acetabular fractures
Femoral head fractures
Femoral neck fractures
Ipsilateral femoral shaft fractures (floating hip)
Pelvic ring disruptions
Vascular injuries, particularly disruption of the femoral artery or vein
Sciatic nerve injury, which can present with sensory deficits and/or motor weakness in the affected limb
Physical Examination
A thorough physical examination is essential for identifying clinical features of hip dislocation and potential associated injuries.
Inspection: Observe for deformity, swelling, ecchymosis, or open wounds.
Palpation: Assess bony prominences and soft tissue structures for tenderness or palpable defects.
Range of motion: Evaluate passive range of motion; active range of motion may be limited due to pain or neurovascular compromise.
Neurovascular status: Assess distal pulses, capillary refill time, sensation, and motor function in the affected limb.
Skin integrity: Examine for abrasions or lacerations that may indicate an open dislocation.

Investigations
Radiographic evaluation is crucial for confirming the diagnosis and identifying any associated injuries.
Anteroposterior (AP) pelvis view: Provides a comprehensive assessment of pelvic alignment and symmetry.
Lateral view of the affected hip joint: Useful for visualizing anterior or posterior displacement of the femoral head.
Judet views (obturator oblique and iliac oblique): Helpful in assessing acetabulum integrity and detecting occult fractures.
Computed tomography (CT) scan with three-dimensional reconstruction: Offers detailed visualization of complex fracture patterns and aids in surgical planning.

Management
Management of hip dislocation
ABCDE approach.
Analgesia
A reduction under general anaesthetic within 4 hours to reduce the risk of avascular necrosis.
Long-term management: Physiotherapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles.
Improve
Complications
- Sciatic or femoral nerve injury
Avascular necrosis
Osteoarthritis: more common in older patients.
Recurrent dislocation: due to damage of supporting ligaments
Improve
Prognosis
Prognosis
It takes about 2 to 3 months for the hip to heal after a traumatic dislocation
The prognosis is best when the hip is reduced less than 12 hours post-injury and when there is less damage to the joint.
