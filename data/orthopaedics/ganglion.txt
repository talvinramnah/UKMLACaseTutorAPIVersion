Ganglion
Ganglion
A ganglion is a common benign cystic swelling that arises from the synovial lining of joints or tendon sheaths. They are most commonly found in the wrist and hand. The exact cause of ganglion formation is unknown, but it is believed to be related to joint or tendon irritation. Patients may present with pain, discomfort, or cosmetic concerns. Diagnosis is usually made clinically, but imaging studies such as ultrasound may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment options include observation, aspiration, and surgical excision. Aspiration may provide temporary relief, but recurrence rates are high. Surgical excision is the definitive treatment and has a low recurrence rate.

Clinical features
Patients with ganglion cysts often present with a painless, slowly enlarging mass near a joint or tendon sheath. The size of the cyst can vary significantly, ranging from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. The overlying skin is usually unremarkable, with no signs of erythema or inflammation.
Location
The most frequent site for ganglion cyst formation is the dorsal aspect of the wrist, accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. Other common locations include:
Volar aspect of the wrist
Flexor tendon sheaths at the base of fingers (especially in association with flexor retinaculum)
Dorsal interphalangeal joints (mucous cysts)
Tarsal joints and ligaments within the foot
Palpation
On palpation, ganglion cysts are typically round or oval-shaped and exhibit smooth contours. They may be soft or firm depending on their size and content; larger cysts containing viscous synovial fluid tend to be firmer than smaller ones. Most ganglions are freely mobile over underlying structures but remain tethered to their origin by a pedicle known as the 'stalk' or 'tail.'
Transillumination
A useful diagnostic technique for differentiating ganglion cysts from solid masses is transillumination using a penlight or other light source placed directly against the lesion's surface. The majority of ganglions will appear translucent or partially translucent, indicating the presence of fluid within the cyst.
Pain and Limitation of Movement
Although ganglion cysts are often asymptomatic, they can cause pain or discomfort in some patients. This may be due to compression of adjacent nerves or increased pressure on surrounding structures during joint movement. Additionally, larger cysts may impede normal joint function and restrict the range of motion.
Fluctuation and Spontaneity
Ganglion cysts may exhibit fluctuating size over time, with periods of growth and regression. In some cases, spontaneous rupture can occur, leading to a sudden decrease in size accompanied by local inflammation and pain. However, it is important to note that recurrence is common following spontaneous resolution.

Management
Observation and reassurance
In most cases, ganglions are asymptomatic and do not require intervention.
Advise patients on the benign nature of the lesion and monitor for changes in size or symptoms.
