Cubital tunnel syndrome
Cubital tunnel syndrome
Cubital tunnel syndrome occurs due to compression of the ulnar nerve as it passes through the cubital tunnel.

Clinical features
Clincial features
Tingling and numbness of the 4th and 5th finger which starts off intermittent and then becomes constant.
Over time patients may also develop weakness and muscle wasting
Pain worse on leaning on the affected elbow
Often a history of osteoarthritis or prior trauma to the area.

Investigations
- Cubital tunnel syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis, but investigations are useful to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate severity, and exclude alternative or contributory pathologies.
First-line investigations
Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG)
These are the gold standard for confirming ulnar nerve compression at the elbow.
NCS typically demonstrate slowed conduction velocity across the cubital tunnel segment of the ulnar nerve.
EMG may show evidence of denervation in ulnar-innervated muscles if there is significant or chronic compression.
These tests help to distinguish cubital tunnel syndrome from other sites of ulnar neuropathy or more proximal neurological disorders.
Further investigations
Imaging is not routinely required but may be indicated in specific scenarios:
Plain radiographs of the elbow can identify bony abnormalities such as osteophytes, previous fractures, or deformities that could contribute to nerve compression.
Ultrasound can visualise dynamic changes in the ulnar nerve during elbow movement and assess for structural lesions (e.g. ganglion cysts).
MRI is reserved for complex cases where a mass lesion or atypical pathology is suspected.
Key points
Nerve conduction studies are essential for confirmation and localisation of ulnar nerve compression.
Imaging should be reserved for atypical presentations or when secondary causes are suspected.
Blood tests have no role unless systemic disease (e.g. diabetes) is suspected as a contributing factor.

Management
Management Approach
The primary aim of treatment is to relieve ulnar nerve compression, reduce symptoms, and prevent progression of neurological deficit
Management strategy depends on symptom severity, duration, and the presence of motor weakness or muscle wasting
Conservative management is appropriate for mild to moderate cases, while surgical intervention may be necessary for severe or progressive disease
Conservative Management
First-line treatment for mild to moderate symptoms without significant motor weakness:
Avoidance of activities that exacerbate symptoms, particularly prolonged elbow flexion
Patient education regarding positional modifications to reduce nerve compression
Nocturnal elbow splinting in extension or slight flexion (15-45Â°) to prevent prolonged elbow flexion during sleep
Elbow padding to protect the ulnar nerve from external compression
Activity modification to avoid direct pressure on the elbow and repetitive flexion/extension
Physiotherapy may be beneficial:
Nerve gliding exercises to improve nerve mobility
Strengthening exercises for the intrinsic hand muscles if weakness is present
NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary
recommends a trial of conservative management for 3-6 months before considering surgical referral
Surgical Management
Surgical intervention should be considered in:
Patients with severe symptoms unresponsive to conservative management
Cases with progressive neurological deficit or muscle wasting
Patients with persistent symptoms after 3-6 months of conservative treatment
Surgical options include:
In situ decompression
- simple release of compressive structures around the nerve
Medial epicondylectomy
- removal of part of the medial epicondyle to reduce tension on the nerve
Anterior transposition
- relocating the nerve anterior to the medial epicondyle (subcutaneous, intramuscular, or submuscular)
Post-operative rehabilitation is essential:
Gradual return to activities with physiotherapy guidance
Nerve gliding exercises to prevent adhesions
Strengthening exercises for intrinsic hand muscles
Patients should be counselled that:
Complete symptom resolution may take several months
Sensory symptoms typically improve before motor function
Recovery may be incomplete in cases with longstanding motor deficit
