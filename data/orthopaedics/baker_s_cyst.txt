Baker's cyst
Baker's cyst
Baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is a fluid-filled sac that develops behind the knee joint. It is often associated with underlying knee joint conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and meniscal tears. Patients with Baker's cyst may present with pain, swelling, and stiffness in the affected knee, which can limit their mobility and daily activities.
Diagnosis of Baker's cyst can be made through physical examination, imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI. Treatment options include conservative measures such as rest, ice, compression, and elevation, as well as medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove the cyst or address the underlying knee joint condition.
