Biceps tendonitis
Biceps tendonitis
Biceps tendonitis is a common condition that affects the long head of the biceps tendon. It is characterized by pain and tenderness in the front of the shoulder, which may worsen with overhead activities or lifting heavy objects. The condition is often caused by repetitive overhead motions, such as those performed by athletes or manual labourers. It can also be caused by degenerative changes in the tendon due to aging or injury.
Diagnosis of biceps tendonitis is typically made through a physical exam and imaging studies, such as ultrasound or MRI. Treatment options include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or remove the damaged tendon.

Clinical features
Patients with biceps tendonitis typically present with anterior
shoulder pain
, which may be exacerbated by overhead activities or movements involving shoulder flexion, supination, or abduction. The pain is often localized over the bicipital groove and can radiate distally along the anterior aspect of the arm.
During the physical examination, physicians should assess for tenderness over the bicipital groove, which may indicate inflammation of the long head of the biceps tendon. Additionally, provocative tests such as Speed's test and Yergason's test can help confirm a diagnosis.
Speed's Test: This test involves having the patient flex their elbow at 90 degrees while maintaining forearm supination and resisting downward force applied by the examiner on their palm. Increased pain in the bicipital groove during this manoeuvre suggests biceps tendonitis.
Yergason's Test: In this test, patients are asked to maintain elbow flexion at 90 degrees and pronate their forearm while resisting supination force applied by an examiner. Pain or discomfort in the area of the long head of the biceps tendon during this manoeuvre indicates possible inflammation.
Other clinical features that may be observed in patients with biceps tendonitis include muscle weakness (particularly during resisted supination), decreased range of motion (ROM) in shoulder flexion or abduction due to pain, and crepitus overlying the affected tendon region during active movements.
It is crucial for physicians to consider differential diagnoses when assessing patients with anterior shoulder pain, as several other conditions may present similarly. These include rotator cuff pathology, adhesive capsulitis, glenohumeral joint arthritis, and subacromial bursitis.
