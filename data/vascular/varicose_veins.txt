Varicose veins
Varicose veins
Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous, superficial veins that occur secondary to incompetent venous valves, allowing blood to flow back, away from the heart. They most commonly occur in the legs due to reflux in the great saphenous vein and small saphenous vein. Whilst extremely common, the vast majority of patients do not require any intervention.

Clinical features
For many patients, the cosmetic appearance may prompt presentation. However other patients may complain of symptoms:
aching, throbbing
itching
Other patients may present with complications of varicose veins:
a variety of skin changes may be seen:
varicose eczema (also known as venous stasis)
haemosiderin deposition → hyperpigmentation
lipodermatosclerosis → hard/tight skin
atrophie blanche → hypopigmentation
bleeding
superficial thrombophlebitis
venous ulceration
deep vein thrombosis

Management
Management
the majority of patients with varicose veins do not require surgery. Conservative treatments include:
leg elevation
weight loss
regular exercise
graduated compression stockings
reasons for referral to secondary care include:
significant/troublesome lower limb symptoms e.g. pain, discomfort or swelling
previous bleeding from varicose veins
skin changes secondary to chronic venous insufficiency (e.g. pigmentation and eczema)
superficial thrombophlebitis
an active or healed venous leg ulcer
possible treatments:
endothermal ablation: using either radiofrequency ablation or endovenous laser treatment
foam sclerotherapy: irritant foam → inflammatory response → closure of the vein
surgery: either ligation or stripping
