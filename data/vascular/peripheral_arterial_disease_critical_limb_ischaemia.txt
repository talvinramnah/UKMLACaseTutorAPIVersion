Clinical features
Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is a severe form of PAD that can lead to tissue loss, gangrene, and amputation if left untreated. The presenting features of CLI are as follows:
Pain at rest:
Patients with CLI often experience pain in their feet or legs even when they are at rest. This pain is typically described as a burning or aching sensation and is often worse at night
Non-healing wounds:
Patients with CLI may develop non-healing wounds on their feet or legs. These wounds may be small or large and may be accompanied by drainage or an odour
Gangrene:
In severe cases of CLI, patients may develop gangrene, which is the death of tissue due to lack of blood flow. Gangrene can cause the affected area to turn black and emit a foul odour
