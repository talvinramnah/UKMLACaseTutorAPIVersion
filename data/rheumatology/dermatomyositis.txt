Pathophysiology
Pathophysiology
may be idiopathic or associated with connective tissue disorders or underlying malignancy (typically ovarian, breast and lung cancer, found in 20-25% - more if patient older). Screening for an underlying malignancy is usually performed following a diagnosis of dermatomyositis
polymyositis
is a variant of the disease where skin manifestations are not prominent

Clinical features
Skin features
photosensitive
macular rash over back and shoulder
heliotrope rash in the periorbital region
Gottron's papules - roughened red papules over extensor surfaces of fingers
'mechanic's hands': extremely dry and scaly hands with linear 'cracks' on the palmar and lateral aspects of the fingers
nail fold capillary dilatation
Other features
proximal muscle weakness
+/- tenderness
Raynaud's
respiratory muscle weakness
interstitial lung disease: e.g. Fibrosing alveolitis or organising pneumonia
dysphagia
, dysphonia

Investigations
Antibodies
the majority of patients (around 80%) are
ANA
positive
around 30% of patients have antibodies to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (anti-synthetase antibodies), including:
antibodies against histidine-tRNA ligase (also called Jo-1)
antibodies to signal recognition particle (SRP)
anti-Mi-2 antibodies
Creatine kinase is elevated.
Skin and muscle biopsies may be done to confirm the diagnosis.
Electromyography
useful in distinguishing myopathy from neuropathy

Management
Aims and General Approach
The principal aims in the management of dermatomyositis are to:
suppress muscle and skin inflammation
improve muscle strength and function
prevent complications such as contractures, aspiration, and interstitial lung disease
screen for, and manage, any associated malignancy or interstitial lung involvement
Management should be individualised based on severity, organ involvement, age, comorbidities, and presence of malignancy.
Multidisciplinary care is essential, involving
rheumatology
(or neurology), dermatology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and respiratory teams where indicated.
Immunosuppressive Therapy
Corticosteroids remain the first-line treatment
for active dermatomyositis. According to
NICE
guidelines and expert consensus:
oral corticosteroids are typically initiated at a high dose until clinical improvement is achieved
intravenous pulsed corticosteroids may be considered in severe or rapidly progressive cases (e.g.
dysphagia
or respiratory compromise)
Most patients require additional immunosuppressive agents (steroid-sparing agents) due to either inadequate response or adverse effects from long-term steroids. Commonly used agents include:
methotrexate
azathioprine
mycophenolate mofetil (particularly if there is significant lung involvement)
For refractory disease or intolerance to first-line immunosuppressants:
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be considered; this has particular utility in severe weakness or bulbar involvement (
BNF/NICE
)
rituximab may be used in selected cases with resistant disease
Additional Considerations
Cutaneous manifestations often require adjunctive topical therapies alongside systemic treatment:
topical corticosteroids are commonly prescribed for localised skin lesions
sun protection is strongly advised due to
photosensitivity
of rashesâ€”this should be reinforced at every consultation
Interstitial lung disease requires early recognition; input from respiratory specialists is recommended for those with pulmonary symptoms or radiological evidence.
immunosuppression regimens may need adjustment depending on severity of lung involvement
baseline and interval pulmonary function tests are advised according to
NICE
recommendations
Malignancy screening should be undertaken at diagnosis and repeated periodically thereafter, especially within the first three years following diagnosis when risk is highest.
Physiotherapy plays an important role in maintaining muscle strength and preventing contractures; early referral for tailored exercise programmes is recommended.
In children (juvenile dermatomyositis), management follows similar principles but should involve specialist paediatric rheumatology input.
Early initiation of appropriate immunosuppression improves prognosis
, reduces long-term disability, and minimises complications.
