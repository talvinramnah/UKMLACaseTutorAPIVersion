Temporal arteritis
Temporal arteritis
Temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis, is a vasculitis predominantly affecting medium and large arteries, particularly the branches of the carotid artery.
It typically presents in patients over 50 years of age with symptoms such as new-onset
headache
, scalp tenderness,
jaw claudication
, and visual disturbances. Systemic manifestations may include
fever
, weight loss, and
polymyalgia rheumatica
. The pathophysiology involves granulomatous inflammation leading to arterial wall thickening and luminal narrowing.
Diagnosis is supported by elevated inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but definitive diagnosis requires temporal artery biopsy revealing characteristic histopathological features including multinucleated giant cells. Imaging modalities like Doppler ultrasound or MRI angiography can aid in diagnosis by demonstrating vessel wall oedema and stenosis.
Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment to reduce inflammation and prevent complications like irreversible vision loss.

Aetiology
The precise aetiology of temporal arteritis remains unclear; however, several factors are thought to contribute to its development:
Genetic predisposition:
Certain HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*04, have been associated with an increased risk of developing GCA.
Environmental factors:
Seasonal variations and geographical clustering suggest a potential role of environmental factors, possibly infectious agents, in triggering the disease.
Age:
Temporal arteritis is primarily a disease of older adults, with a peak incidence between the ages of 70 and 80. The risk increases with age, and the condition is rare in individuals under 50.
Sex:
Women are affected more frequently than men, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2-3:1.
Ethnicity:
GCA is more common in individuals of Northern European descent, particularly those of Scandinavian origin.

Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of temporal arteritis is complex and not yet fully understood. It is believed to involve an interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immune dysregulation, leading to vascular inflammation and damage. Key aspects of the pathogenesis include:
Antigenic trigger:
An unknown antigenic stimulus, possibly an infectious agent, is thought to initiate an immune response in genetically susceptible individuals.
T-cell activation:
The antigenic stimulus activates CD4+ T-cells, which migrate to the arterial wall and initiate an inflammatory cascade.
Macrophage and giant cell formation:
Activated T-cells stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), leading to the recruitment and activation of macrophages. These macrophages can fuse to form multinucleated giant cells, which are characteristic of GCA.
Vascular inflammation and damage:
The ongoing inflammatory process within the arterial wall results in intimal thickening, luminal narrowing, and ischemia. In severe cases, this can progress to vessel occlusion, tissue infarction, and even aneurysm formation.

Clinical features
Features
typically patient > 60 years old
usually rapid onset (e.g. < 1 month)
headache
(found in 85%)
jaw claudication
(65%)
vision testing is a key investigation in all patients
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
accounts for the majority of ocular complications. It results from occlusion of the
posterior ciliary artery
(a branch of the ophthalmic artery) → ischaemia of the optic nerve head. Fundoscopy typically shows a
swollen pale disc and blurred margins
may result in temporary
visual loss
- amaurosis fugax
permanent visual loss is the most feared complication of temporal arteritis and may develop suddenly
diplopia may also result from the involvement of any part of the oculomotor system (e.g. cranial nerves)
tender, palpable temporal artery
around 50% have features of PMR: aching, morning stiffness in proximal limb muscles (not weakness)

classification criteria, if
3 or more of the criteria
are present below, the patient is highly suspected to have temporal arteritis
Age of onset≥50 years
New onset of headache
Temporal artery abnormality: tenderness, thickening or reduced pulsation of temporal artery
ESR>50mm/hr

Investigations
Investigations
raised inflammatory markers
ESR > 50 mm/hr (note ESR < 30 in 10% of patients)
CRP may also be elevated
temporal artery biopsy
skip lesions may be present
note creatine kinase and EMG normal
Guidelines suggest investigations should be guided by the pre-test probability of temporal arteritis.
For a
low clinical probability
of temporal arteritis (<20%): order a temporal and axillary artery ultrasound scan.
If the ultrasound result is positive (eg. detection of halo sign, stenosis/occluded vessel), arrange for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. It should be carried out within 14 days after commencing steroid therapy
If the ultrasound result is negative, consider alternative diagnoses
For a
medium clinical probability
of temporal arteritis (20-50%): ultrasound may be performed prior to biopsy to aid in diagnostic certainty in case the biopsy is negative
For a
high clinical probability
of temporal arteritis (>50%): a positive ultrasound alone may be sufficient to make a diagnosis of temporal arteritis
If an ultrasound scan is unavailable, patients should still have a temporal artery biopsy.
Treatment should not be delayed whilst investigations are carried out.

Differential diagnosis
As a general rule, we should always rule out common conditions and diseases that require urgent treatment before thinking of the rare diagnosis. Here, we should consider causes of sudden loss of vision as well as conditions that may present with worrying symptoms such as
fever
, weight loss and pain.
Possible differential diagnoses include:
Migraine
:
Similarities: severe
headache
Differences: No
visual loss
but only temporary visual disturbance experience such as photophobia, scotoma in the shape of a jagged crescent, hemianopia or jumbling of lines and dots, no muscle stiffness
Central retinal artery occlusion:
Similarities: sudden onset, loss of vision
Differences: fundoscopy may reveal presence of cherry red spot with retinal whitening, no muscle stiffness
Acute glaucoma
Similarities: sudden onset, severe pain within/around the eye,associated headache, blurring of vision, loss of vision
Differences: redness of eye, hazy cornea, nausea and vomiting
Trigeminal neuralgia:
Similarities: sudden onset, jaw pain
Differences: No vision impairment
Multiple sclerosis
Similarities: sudden onset, loss of vision, diplopia, blurring of vision
Differences: there is pain on eye movements, facial weakness, weakness of lower limb and autonomic dysfunction (eg. Urine incontinence)
Polymyositis
Similarities:
fatigue
, myalgia
Differences:
proximal muscle weakness
in polymyositis which is not a feature of PMR, raised creatinine kinase, no visual impairment
Improve
Management
Initial management involves the prompt initiation of high-dose corticosteroids to prevent irreversible vision loss. Prednisolone is typically the first-line treatment, and intravenous methylprednisolone may be considered in cases with severe visual impairment or visual symptoms.
Adjunctive therapy with low-dose aspirin should be considered to reduce the risk of ischemic complications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be prescribed to mitigate gastrointestinal side effects associated with corticosteroid therapy.
Patients should undergo temporal artery biopsy within 14 days of starting corticosteroid treatment to confirm the diagnosis histologically. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound or MRI can be utilised if biopsy is contraindicated or non-diagnostic.
In patients who cannot tolerate corticosteroids or require long-term steroid-sparing strategies, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate or tocilizumab may be employed. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, has shown efficacy in reducing relapse rates and maintaining remission.
Regular ophthalmologic assessments are recommended for monitoring potential complications such as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Bone protection strategies including calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonates should be implemented due to the increased risk of osteoporosis from prolonged corticosteroid use.
Consideration should also be given to cardiovascular risk factors given the association between temporal arteritis and large vessel vasculitis. Regular monitoring for aortic aneurysms and stenoses via imaging studies is advised for comprehensive vascular assessment.

Complications
If left untreated or inadequately managed, it can lead to various complications, some of which may be severe or irreversible. The following are notable complications associated with temporal arteritis:
Vision loss:
The most feared and serious complication of GCA is irreversible vision loss due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. This occurs when the inflammation and subsequent occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries compromise blood flow to the optic nerve, leading to ischemia and irreversible damage.
Ocular complications:
GCA can cause other ocular complications, such as retinal artery occlusion, diplopia, and ptosis, as a result of ischemia affecting the ocular muscles or nerves.
Stroke:
In rare cases, inflammation and occlusion of cerebral arteries can lead to ischemic stroke. Patients with GCA have a higher risk of cerebrovascular events compared to the general population.
Aortic aneurysm and dissection:
GCA can affect the aorta, leading to aortitis, which may progress to aortic aneurysm or dissection. This can result in life-threatening complications, such as rupture or compression of adjacent structures.
Large vessel involvement:
In addition to the cranial arteries, GCA can also involve other large vessels, such as the subclavian, axillary, and vertebral arteries, leading to limb claudication, upper extremity ischemia, or vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
Polymyalgia rheumatica
(PMR):
Up to 50% of patients with GCA may develop PMR, an inflammatory condition characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulders, neck, and pelvic girdle.
Systemic complications:
GCA can lead to various systemic complications, such as
fever
,
malaise
, weight loss, and anaemia. Additionally, the long-term use of corticosteroids for treatment can result in complications like osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, and increased susceptibility to infections.
