Clinical features
Typical Presentation
Fibromyalgia typically presents with
chronic widespread pain
lasting more than 3 months, affecting both sides of the body, above and below the waist, and including axial skeletal pain
Patients often describe the pain as constant, deep, aching, or burning in nature
Most patients report
significant
fatigue
and
non-restorative sleep
despite adequate sleep duration
Cognitive difficulties (often called "fibro fog") are frequently reported, including problems with concentration, attention, and memory
Key Clinical Features
Musculoskeletal symptoms:
Widespread pain without obvious inflammatory or structural cause
Pain that may fluctuate in intensity and location
Characteristic tender points on examination, particularly at muscle-tendon junctions
Increased sensitivity to pressure (allodynia and hyperalgesia)
Morning stiffness lasting 30 minutes or more
Neurological symptoms:
Paraesthesia and numbness, often in hands and feet
Headaches, including tension-type and migraines
Hypersensitivity to multiple stimuli (light, sound, temperature, odours)
Psychological symptoms:
Low mood and anxiety are common
Irritability and emotional lability
Poor stress tolerance
Other associated symptoms:
Irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms
(abdominal pain, bloating, constipation/diarrhoea)
Bladder symptoms including frequency and urgency
Temperature dysregulation
Dry eyes and mouth
Symptom Patterns
Symptoms often
fluctuate in severity
, with flare-ups commonly triggered by:
Physical or emotional stress
Poor sleep
Changes in weather (particularly cold or damp conditions)
Excessive physical activity
Many patients report a gradual onset of symptoms, though some can identify a precipitating event such as:
Physical trauma
Severe illness or infection
Significant psychological stress
The condition typically follows a chronic course with periods of exacerbation and relative improvement
Symptoms often significantly impact daily functioning, with many patients reporting reduced quality of life and difficulty maintaining employment

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is clinical and sometimes refers to the American College of
Rheumatology
classification criteria which lists 9 pairs of tender points on the body. If a patient is tender in at least 11 of these 18 points it makes a diagnosis of fibromyalgia more likely

Management
The management of fibromyalgia is often difficult and needs to be tailored to the individual patient. A psychosocial and multidisciplinary approach is helpful. Unfortunately there is currently a paucity of evidence and guidelines to guide practice. The following is partly based on consensus guidelines from the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) published in 2007 and also a BMJ review in 2014.
explanation
aerobic exercise: has the strongest evidence base
cognitive behavioural therapy
medication: pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline
