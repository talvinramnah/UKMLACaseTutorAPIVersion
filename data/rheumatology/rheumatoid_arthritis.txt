Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by symmetrical inflammation of the synovial joints, leading to progressive joint destruction, disability, and extra-articular manifestations. The exact aetiology is unknown, but genetic factors, such as HLA-DRB1, environmental triggers, and dysregulated immune responses contribute to its pathogenesis. RA primarily affects women, with a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades of life.
Clinically, RA presents with persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, predominantly in the hands, wrists, and feet. Morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes is a hallmark symptom. Extra-articular manifestations include rheumatoid nodules, interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, and increased cardiovascular risk.
Diagnosis relies on clinical criteria, laboratory tests (e.g.,
rheumatoid factor
, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies), and imaging (e.g., X-ray, ultrasound). Management involves a multidisciplinary approach, with pharmacotherapy (e.g., NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics), physical therapy, and patient education. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent irreversible joint damage and reduce morbidity.

Aetiology
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial autoimmune disease with a largely unknown aetiology. However, several risk factors and underlying causes have been identified which contribute to its development.
Genetic Factors
Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes: The HLA-DRB1 locus is strongly associated with RA susceptibility, particularly the shared epitope alleles.
Non-HLA genes: Other genetic loci linked to RA include PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1, C5-TRAF1 and CTLA4 among others. These genes are involved in immune regulation and inflammatory response mechanisms.
Environmental Factors
Cigarette smoking:
This is the most consistent environmental risk factor linked to RA. Smokers with specific HLA genotypes have an increased risk of developing seropositive RA.
Infections:
Various infectious agents such as
Epstein-Barr virus
,
Parvovirus B19
, and
Porphyromonas gingivalis
have been proposed as potential triggers for RA but conclusive evidence remains elusive.
Silica exposure:
Occupational exposure to silica dust has been associated with an increased risk of developing RA.
Hormonal Factors
Pregnancy:
Pregnancy appears to reduce the risk of onset of RA but may also lead to post-partum flare-ups in women who already have the disease.
Menses and menopause:
Early menarche, irregular menses or early menopause may increase the risk of developing RA. Post-menopausal women also have a higher risk, suggesting a protective role of endogenous hormones.
Lifestyle Factors
Obesity:
Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing RA and may affect disease severity and response to treatment.
Diet:
Certain dietary factors such as high intake of red meat or low intake of fruits, vegetables and vitamin D may increase the risk of RA.

Pathophysiology
Immune Dysregulation
RA is characterized by a complex interplay of innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to chronic inflammation and joint destruction:
Autoantibodies:
Rheumatoid factor
(RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are commonly detected in RA patients, and ACPA-positive RA has distinct genetic and environmental risk factors
T cells:
CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, particularly Th1 and Th17 subsets, contribute to synovial inflammation by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and activating other immune cells
B cells:
Produce autoantibodies, act as antigen-presenting cells, and secrete cytokines, further propagating the inflammatory response
Macrophages and neutrophils:
Release cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and contribute to synovial inflammation and joint damage
Synovial Inflammation and Joint Damage
The inflammatory milieu in the synovial joint results in synovial hyperplasia, pannus formation, and subsequent joint destruction:
Synoviocytes:
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophage-like synoviocytes (MLS) undergo hyperplasia, contributing to synovial thickening and producing matrix-degrading enzymes
Pannus formation:
The invasive pannus, composed of FLS, macrophages, and other immune cells, contributes to cartilage and bone destruction
Angiogenesis:
Neovascularization supports the growth of the pannus and increases the influx of immune cells into the synovium
Bone erosion:
Osteoclasts, activated by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) and other factors, resorb bone at sites of pannus invasion

Clinical features
Symmetrical Joint Involvement
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically manifests as symmetrical polyarthritis, with joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. The small joints of the hands and feet, such as metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, are predominantly affected. Larger joints, including the knees, shoulders, and elbows, can also be involved.
Morning Stiffness
A characteristic feature of RA is morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes, which may improve with activity. Stiffness can also occur after periods of inactivity, known as 'gelling.'
Joint Swelling
The affected joints may exhibit soft tissue swelling due to synovitis, joint effusion, and periarticular inflammation.
Fatigue
Patients with RA often report fatigue, which can be attributed to the chronic inflammatory state, anaemia of chronic disease, sleep disturbances, or medication side effects.
Constitutional Symptoms
Systemic symptoms such as low-grade
fever
, weight loss, and general
malaise
may accompany the joint manifestations in some patients.
Onset and Progression
RA typically has an insidious onset, with symptoms developing over weeks to months. However, some patients may present with a more acute onset. The course of the disease can be variable, ranging from intermittent flares to persistent, unremitting inflammation.
Extra-articular Manifestations
Although extra-articular manifestations are more common in established RA, they can occasionally present early in the disease course. These may include rheumatoid nodules, interstitial lung disease, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and anemia of chronic disease.

Investigations
Rheumatoid factor
Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a circulating antibody (usually IgM) which reacts with the Fc portion of the patients own IgG
RF can be detected by either
Rose-Waaler test: sheep red cell agglutination
Latex agglutination test (less specific)
RF is positive in 70-80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, high titre levels are associated with severe progressive disease (but NOT a marker of disease activity)
Other conditions associated with a positive RF include:
Sjogren's syndrome (around 100%)
Felty's syndrome (around 100%)
infective endocarditis (= 50%)
SLE
(= 20-30%)
systemic sclerosis (= 30%)
general population (= 5%)
rarely: TB, HBV, EBV, leprosy
Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody
Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody may be detectable up to 10 years before the development of rheumatoid arthritis. It may therefore play a key role in the future of rheumatoid arthritis, allowing early detection of patients suitable for aggressive anti-TNF therapy. It has a sensitivity similar to rheumatoid factor (around 70%) with a much higher specificity of 90-95%.
NICE recommends that patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis who are rheumatoid factor negative should be test for anti-CCP antibodies.

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be challenging due to its overlap with various other conditions. Three key differential diagnoses include osteoarthritis (OA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and
systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE).
Osteoarthritis
Unlike RA, OA is a degenerative joint disease primarily affecting the cartilage. It does not exhibit the systemic inflammation characteristic of RA.
Clinically, OA usually presents with asymmetric joint involvement, typically in weight-bearing joints like knees and hips, or hands’ distal interphalangeal joints. Morning stiffness in OA generally lasts less than 30 minutes which contrasts with the prolonged morning stiffness seen in RA.
On examination, Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes may be observed in OA which are not typical features of RA.
Psoriatic Arthritis
PsA is another inflammatory arthritis that may mimic RA. However, it is typically associated with psoriasis and often affects skin and nails as well as joints.
Unlike the symmetrical polyarticular pattern commonly seen in RA, PsA often demonstrates an asymmetric oligoarticular pattern. Dactylitis (sausage digits) and enthesitis are also unique features of PsA that help differentiate from RA.
Radiographic findings such as pencil-in-cup deformity or periostitis could aid differentiation; these are not typical for RA.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that may present with arthralgia similar to RA but usually exhibits a wider range of systemic symptoms including malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, serositis, renal and neurological involvement.
SLE arthritis is typically non-erosive and does not lead to the joint deformities commonly observed in RA. Joint involvement in SLE is often migratory and transient.
Presence of autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) or anti-Smith (anti-Sm) are more suggestive of SLE than RA.
Improve
Management
The management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been revolutionised by the introduction of disease-modifying therapies in the past decade.
Patients with evidence of joint inflammation should start a combination of disease-modifying drugs (DMARD) as soon as possible. Other important treatment options include analgesia, physiotherapy and surgery.
Initial therapy
In 2018 NICE updated their rheumatoid arthritis guidelines. They now recommend DMARD
monotherapy
+/- a short-course of bridging
prednisolone
. In the past dual DMARD therapy was advocated as the initial step.
Monitoring response to treatment
NICE recommends using a combination of CRP and disease activity (using a composite score such as DAS28) to assess response to treatment
DMARDs
methotrexate
is the most widely used DMARD. Monitoring of FBC & LFTs is essential due to the risk of myelosuppression and liver cirrhosis. Other important side-effects include pneumonitis
sulfasalazine
leflunomide
hydroxychloroquine
TNF-inhibitors
the current indication for a TNF-inhibitor is an inadequate response to at least two DMARDs including methotrexate
etanercept: recombinant human protein, acts as a decoy receptor for TNF-α, subcutaneous administration, can cause demyelination, risks include reactivation of tuberculosis
infliximab: monoclonal antibody, binds to TNF-α and prevents it from binding with TNF receptors, intravenous administration, risks include reactivation of tuberculosis
adalimumab: monoclonal antibody, subcutaneous administration
Rituximab
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, results in B-cell depletion
two 1g intravenous infusions are given two weeks apart
infusion reactions are common
Abatacept
fusion protein that modulates a key signal required for activation of T lymphocytes
leads to decreased T-cell proliferation and cytokine production
given as an infusion
not currently recommend by NICE

Complications
A wide variety of extra-articular complications occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA):
respiratory: pulmonary fibrosis, pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules, bronchiolitis obliterans,
methotrexate
pneumonitis, pleurisy
ocular: keratoconjunctivitis sicca (most common), episcleritis, scleritis, corneal ulceration, keratitis, steroid-induced cataracts, chloroquine retinopathy
osteoporosis
ischaemic heart disease: RA carries a similar risk to type 2 diabetes mellitus
increased risk of infections
depression
Less common
Felty's syndrome (RA + splenomegaly + low white cell count)
amyloidosis
Respiratory complications
A variety of respiratory problems may be seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis:
pulmonary fibrosis
pleural effusion
pulmonary nodules
bronchiolitis obliterans
complications of drug therapy e.g. methotrexate pneumonitis
pleurisy
Caplan's syndrome - massive fibrotic nodules with occupational coal dust exposure
infection (possibly atypical) secondary to immunosuppression
Ocular complications
Ocular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis are common, with 25% of patients having eye problems
Ocular manifestations
keratoconjunctivitis sicca (most common)
episcleritis (erythema)
scleritis (erythema and pain)
corneal ulceration
keratitis
Iatrogenic
steroid-induced cataracts
chloroquine retinopathy
Improve
Prognosis
A number of features have been shown to predict a poor prognosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as listed below
Poor prognostic features
rheumatoid factor
positive
poor functional status at presentation
HLA DR4
X-ray: early erosions (e.g. after < 2 years)
extra articular features e.g. nodules
insidious onset
anti-CCP antibodies
In terms of gender there seems to be a split in what the established sources state is associated with a poor prognosis. However both the American College of
Rheumatology
and the recent NICE guidelines (which looked at a huge number of prognosis studies) seem to conclude that female gender is associated with a poor prognosis.
