Polyarteritis nodosa
Polyarteritis nodosa
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries with necrotizing inflammation leading to aneurysm formation. PAN is more common in middle-aged men and is associated with hepatitis B infection.

Aetiology
Idiopathic
The majority of Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN) cases are idiopathic, with no identifiable underlying cause.
Infections
Hepatitis B: One of the most well-documented associations, present in up to 30% of PAN cases. The immune complex-mediated mechanism is frequently implicated.
Other Viral Infections: Hepatitis C, HIV, and other viral infections have also been linked but are less common.
Drugs and Medications
Certain drugs, such as hydralazine and allopurinol, have been implicated in case reports but are not commonly associated.
Autoimmune Diseases
Although uncommon, PAN has been linked with other autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
Malignancies
Some studies have shown an association between PAN and haematological malignancies (e.g. hairy cell leukaemia), but the relationship is not yet well-defined.

Pathophysiology
Vasculitis
Inflammation of Medium-sized Arteries
: The hallmark of PAN is necrotising inflammation of the medium-sized arteries, particularly the muscular and elastic types. This inflammation leads to weakening of the arterial wall, aneurysm formation, and organ damage.
Immune Complex Deposition:
In cases associated with HBV, immune complexes formed by the viral antigens and corresponding antibodies are thought to be deposited in the arterial walls, leading to inflammation and damage.
Inflammatory Cell Infiltration
Infiltration of Neutrophils and Monocytes:
The inflammatory process in PAN involves infiltration of the arterial wall by neutrophils and monocytes. This leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, exacerbating the damage.
Fibrinoid Necrosis:
The inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells lead to fibrinoid necrosis of the arterial wall.
Organ Damage
Ischaemia and Infarction:
The inflammation and damage to the arterial wall can lead to stenosis or occlusion of the vessel, resulting in ischaemia and infarction of the downstream tissues.
Aneurysm Formation:
The weakening of the arterial wall can lead to the formation of microaneurysms, which can rupture, causing haemorrhage.

Investigations
Various tests can be performed to diagnose or to ascertain the extent of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN):
Laboratory testing
: There is no diagnostic laboratory test for PAN. Basic laboratory tests help ascertain the extent of involvement of different organs. They include:
Liver function tests
Hepatitis B and C serologies
Creatinine kinase
Serum creatinine
Urine analysis
Acute phase proteins (ESR and C reactive protein are significantly elevated, though they are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis)
Chest radiography
may be obtained to exclude other forms of vasculitis, which have greater involvement in the lungs.
Biopsy
is performed on a
clinically affected organ
to
confirm the diagnosis
.
Imaging:
Arteriography
(mesenteric or renal) can be used as an alternative to biopsy to confirm the diagnosis (to minimise bleeding risk). It can reveal aneurysms and irregular constrictions in the vessels.
Computed tomography/Magnetic resonance imaging
can demonstrate wedge shaped renal infarctions, which are less specific than microaneurysms showed on arteriography.
Improve
Differential diagnosis
PAN is a multisystemic illness, and hence various diseases can be considered in differentials for PAN. They include infectious processes as well as other forms of vasculitis.
Infectious causes include HBV and HCV, which can also cause secondary PAN that can be differentiated on biopsy.
Fever
, murmur, or associated weight loss can also be caused by
infective endocarditis
, which should be subsequently ruled out by blood cultures and echocardiogram.
Atherosclerosis can also cause infarctions in various organs, causing similar symptoms, with similar age of onset as PAN. They can be both differentiated on histology.
Hypercoagulable states
Antiphospholipid syndrome may present with a history of multiple abortions, although uterine involvement may also be seen with PAN in some patients.
Purpuric lesions can mimic those of thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura
Vasospastic disorders
Other multisystem inflammatory disorders
Sarcoidosis, also a multisystemic illness and a diagnosis of exclusion
Malignancy
Lymphoma and leukaemia can be diagnosed with bone marrow biopsy.

Management
General Principles
Management of Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN) is generally guided by the severity of the disease. The primary goals are to induce remission, maintain remission, and manage complications.
Induction of Remission:
The initial phase of treatment aims at controlling the active disease and inducing remission.
Maintenance of Remission:
After achieving remission, the focus shifts to maintaining remission and preventing relapse.
Management of Complications:
PAN can lead to various complications such as
hypertension
, renal impairment, and peripheral neuropathy which require specific management.
Induction of Remission
Corticosteroids:
High-dose glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment for inducing remission in PAN. Prednisolone at a dose of 1mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/day) is usually recommended. The dose should be tapered gradually once the clinical symptoms have improved and inflammatory markers have normalised.
Cyclophosphamide:
For patients with severe PAN or organ-threatening disease, cyclophosphamide is usually added. The typical dose is 2 mg/kg/day orally or 15 mg/kg intravenously every 2-3 weeks.
Maintenance of Remission
Azathioprine or Methotrexate:
Once remission is induced, cyclophosphamide can be replaced with azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) or methotrexate (15-25 mg/week) as maintenance therapy.
Corticosteroids:
Continue with a lower dose of corticosteroids and taper gradually.
Management of Complications
Hypertension:
Antihypertensive medications as per standard guidelines.
Renal Impairment:
Management includes control of hypertension, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, and dialysis if necessary.
Peripheral Neuropathy:
Neuropathic pain can be managed with medications like gabapentin or amitriptyline.

Clinical manifestations of PAN, in the order of decreasing frequency, include:
Systemic symptoms
Fever

malaise
, weight loss
Neuropathy
Mononeuritis multiplex, polyneuropathy
Arthralgias and/or myalgias
Cutaneous
Livedo reticularis,
purpura

Renal disease
Elevated creatinine, hematuria, glomerulonephritis
Gastrointestinal symptoms
Abdominal pain
, rectal bleeding
New-onset

Respiratory manifestations
Stroke
Cardiomyopathy, pericarditis
Peripheral vascular disease
Claudication, ischemia, necrosis
Here are important things to keep in mind regarding the morbidity and mortality of PAN.
There is a substantial rate of relapse with PAN, which requires monitoring disease for an indefinite period.
Untreated PAN has a five-year survival rate of 13% as compared to 80% in the case of treated PAN.
HBV-associated PAN has a poorer prognosis than non-HBV-associated PAN.
Major causes of death include renal failure and mesenteric, cardiac and cerebral infarctions. Aneurysms can cause life-threatening bleeding.
