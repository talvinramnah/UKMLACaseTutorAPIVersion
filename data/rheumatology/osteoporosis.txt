Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a complex, progressive skeletal disease that leads to an increased risk of fragility fractures. It can be characterised by a reduced bone mineral density and defects in bone tissue micro-architecture.
Postmenopausal osteoporosis (type I) and age-related osteoporosis (type II) are the most common
primary
forms of osteoporosis.
Secondary osteoporosis
can arise due to:
Hyperthyroidism
Hyperparathyroidism
Alcohol abuse
Immobilisation
Osteoporosis is more common in women than men, highlighting that men have greater bone mass than women at any age and that men exhibit no physiological menopause equivalent. Due to the fact that post-menopausal women experience increased degradation of bone tissue as a result of decreased levels of oestrogen.
Fractures due to osteoporosis are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly populations, with vertebral compression fractures causing acute pain, postural back pain and deformity.
Oral
bisphosphonates
and lifestyle modification, including exercises and vitamin D supplements, are the mainstays of management. Some patients may require monoclonal antibody treatment to prevent further reduction in bone mineral density.

Aetiology
Significantly, bone strength can be divided into
bone density
(determined by the amount of bone present) and
bone quality
(determined by the trabeculization of bone).
Many factors contribute to the risk of osteoporotic fractures, which should be taken into account in the assessment of fracture risk in patients.
Using the
FRAX tool
, the major risk factors associated with osteoporosis can be listed as:
Age (between 40 and 90 years)
Gender
Previous fracture
Parent fractured hip
Smoking
Glucocorticoids (more than 3 months at a dose of prednisolone 5mg daily)
Rheumatoid arthritis
Secondary osteoporosis
Alcohol consumption
BMD
Improve
Pathophysiology
Osteoporosis results from
increased
bone breakdown by
osteoclasts
+
decreased
bone formation by
osteoblasts
â→ loss of bone mass.
Bone mass typically decreases with age in all populations but the degree of osteoporosis depends on the
'peak' mass
attained in adult life and the
rate of loss
in later life.
Multiple genes are involved including:
Collagen type 1A1
Vitamin D receptor
Oestrogen receptor genes
Not all causes of osteoporosis alter bone micro-architecture and remodelling in the same way:
Oestrogen deficiency
Increased numbers of remodelling units
Premature arrest of osteoblastic synthetic activity and perforation of trabeculae
Loss of resistance to fracture
Glucocorticoids
Induce a high-turnover state initially
(with increased fracture risk evident within 3 months of therapy initiation)
Prolonged use leads to a reduced-turnover rate with a net loss due to reduced synthesis by osteoblasts
Typically occurs with equivalent corticosteroid use of
10mg prednisolone once daily for 3 months
or more
Ageing
Increased turnover at the bone / vascular interface within cortical bone â→ weak structure for stresses in long bones
(trabeculazation of cortical bone)
Improve
Clinical features
Osteoporosis often has a long latent period where it remains asymptomatic and bone mineral density continues to fall before fragility fractures occur, in contrast to many other bone disease.
Increasing age and female sex are significant risk factors for osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis rises from 2% at 50 years to 25% at 80 years in women.
Pathological or fragility fractures
, often the result of a fall, are traditionally the first clinical presentation. Pervasive sequelae include fractures of the proximal femur, humerus, distal radius and compression fractures of the vertebral bodies.
The most common pathological fractures seen include:
Vertebral compression fractures
Often a sudden episode of acute back pain occurring at rest, bending or lifting
Restricted spinal flexion and intensified pain with prolonged standing
Anterior compression fractures in the thoracic spine may lead to thoracic kyphosis (
Dowager's hump
)
Paravertebral muscle spasm and tender upon deep palpation
Only about 1 in 3 vertebral fractures are symptomatic
Appendicular fractures
(fracture of the proximal femur or distal radius following a fall)
Often occur in those with several pre-existing co-morbidities that complicate post-operative recovery (such as pneumonia and DVT)
Neck of femur
fractures present as hip pain, inability to bear weight and upon physical examination there is a shortened and externally rotated leg
Colles fractures
present after a fall on an outstretched arm, wrist pain and reduced range of movement

Investigations
The diagnostic work-up of osteoporosis aims to evaluate the extent of bone density loss, exclude secondary causes of bone loss and prevent further bone destruction.
It is clinically warranted to assess bone density in patients at high risk of fractures or deformity using
serial bone density measurements
, to monitor the effectiveness of therapy or preventative interventions.
This can be achieved using
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
using low doses of radiation to measure bone mineral density. Diagnosis is based on history of prior fragility fracture or low bone mineral density, which is defined as a
T-score â≤-2.5
.
T score:
based on bone mass of young reference population. A score of -1.0 means bone mass of one standard deviation below that of young reference population.
> -1.0 = normal
-1.0 to -2.5 = osteopaenia
< -2.5 = osteoporosis
Plain radiographs
will highlight any fractures and reveal previously asymptomatic vertebral deformities.
Investigations to exclude any
secondary causes of osteoporosis
include:
Quantitative CT and US of the heel
History and physical examination
FBC
U&Es (serum calcium, creatinine, phosphate)
LFTs (ALP, transaminases)
TFTs
25-OH vit D & 1,25-OH vit D
Serum testosterone & prolactin
Lateral radiographs of lumbar and thoracic spine
Protein immunoelectrophoresis and urinary Bence-Jones protein
Improve
Diagnosis
The World Health Organisation (WHO) have published diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis. This is based on bone density measurements determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
Group
Diagnostic Criteria
Normal
Bone mineral density within 1 SD of the mean of a young adult reference population
Osteopenia - low bone mass
Bone mineral density between 1.0 and 2.5 SD below the mean of a young adult reference population
Osteoporosis
Bone mineral density 2.5 or more SD below the mean of a young adult reference population
Severe osteoporosis
Osteoporosis with one or more fragility fractures
According to the criteria, by 75 years-old, an estimated 38% of women will have osteoporosis and 94% will have low bone mass. Although this tool is useful to establish prevalence of osteoporosis, it should not guide treatment. As the risk of osteoporotic fractures in many elderly patients during their lifetime is sufficiently low to avoid intensive treatment.
Therefore, the
FRAX tool
can be used to evaluate fracture risk of patients and guide clinical treatment. It is based on patient models that integrate clinical risk factors and bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck to give the 10-year probability of fracture at the hip or major osteoporotic fracture.
Clinical risk factors used in FRAX include:
Age (between 40 and 90 years)
Gender
Previous fracture
Parent fractured hip
Smoking
Glucocorticoids (more than 3 months at a dose of prednisolone 5mg daily)
Rheumatoid arthritis
Secondary osteoporosis
Alcohol consumption
BMD
Improve
Differential diagnosis
Osteoporosis may easily be confused with other metabolic or neoplastic bone disease.
Possible differential diagnoses:
Osteomalacia
Osteoporosis is associated with a decreased density of normally mineralized bone matrix
Osteomalacia may have increased, normal, or
(most commonly)
decreased bone mineral density, but there is insufficient bone mineralisation
In contrast to osteoporosis
(which remains asymptomatic until fractures occur)
osteomalacia may cause generalised bone pain, tenderness and myopathy.
Osteomalacia may caused by vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption or medication so it is important to measure levels of Calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) and Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)
Paget disease of bone
Increased osteoclastic bone resorption and compensatory increase in osteoblast bone formation
Formation exceeds resorption but new woven bone
('mosaic' architecture)
is weaker than trabecular bone, leading to an increased fracture risk
In contrast to osteoporosis, patients with Paget's disease may have bone pain, joint pain, bone deformities
(such as bowed tibia and skull changes)
and neurological complications from nerve compression
It is also important to consider other bone disease, including neoplastic bone disease such as
myeloma, primary and metastatic bone tumours, lymphoma
As well as secondary causes of osteoporosis such as:
Hyperparathyroidism
Mastocytosis
Sickle cell anaemia

Management
Diagnostic investigations should be completed in order to guide the management of osteoporosis.
Lifestyle modification
for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures is the mainstay initial management, this includes:
Falls risk assessment
Weight-bearing and muscle strengthening exercises
Optimum daily calcium (800-1200mg) and vitamin D (400-800 IU) intake through sunlight and diet or supplements
Calculation of 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture
Pharmacological therapy
using oral
bisphosphonates
should be reserved for those with a 10-year probability of osteoporotic fragility fracture > 1%, or :
A hip or vertebral fracture
T-score <2.5 or less at the femoral neck
T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 and a 10-year probability of a hip fracture >3% using FRAX
Bisphosphonates
:
First line medication to treat osteoporosis
Adhere to hydroxyapatite and inhibits osteoclasts thereby reducing bone resorption
Oral
Alendronate
and
risedronate
are given as 1-weekly doses, whilst
zoledronic acid
as a 1-yearly infusion
They should be taken fasting, with water whilst standing or sitting upright for 30 minutes
May be associated with upper-GI side effects such as oesophagitis
Careful monitoring is required in those with CKD4 or 5
Denosumab
, a monoclonal antibody, should only be used in extensive osteoporosis:
Given as a subcutaneous injection every 6 months
Anti-resorptive agent that increases BMD and reduces fracture risk at the spine
Adverse effects are infrequent but serious:
Dysuria
Cellulitis
Osteonecrosis of the jaw
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is reserved for early postmenopausal women due to its adverse effects on breast cancer and cardiovascular disease risk.
New
vertebral fractures
may require:
Bed rest for 1-2 weeks
Strong analgesia
Muscle relaxants (i.e. diazepam 2mg TDS)
Gradual physiotherapy
There are also treatments for specific patient demographics:
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis
Osteoporosis in men
Greatest rate of bone loss occurs early after initiation of glucocorticoids so bone-protection treatment should be started at onset of therapy
Alendronic acid or Risedronate are first-line treatments for men
Women >70 years-old taking more than 7.5mg prednisolone daily or equivalent are high risk and should have prophylactic bone-protection
Men having long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased fracture risk
IV zolendronic acid or teriparatide are alternatives in those intolerant of oral bisphosphonates
Denosumab is an alternative in those intolerant of bisphosphonates
Testosterone replacement can be used in those with clinical hypogonadism
Improve
Complications
In addition to the increased risk of fractures, osteoporosis can lead to other
direct or indirect complications
, such as:
Limited mobility
Osteoporosis can limit physical activity that may result in weight gain and increase the risk of the long-term sequelae of heart disease and diabetes
Depression
Commonly seen with the loss of independence and isolation
Pain
Fractures of osteoporosis in the spine in particular can lead to a loss of heigh, stooping posture and persistent back pain
Complications of medication
Oral
bisphosphonates
can lead to
oesophagitis
Teriparatide increases the risk of
osteonecrosis of the jaw
and atypical femoral fractures
