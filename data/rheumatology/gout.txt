Gout
Gout
Gout is a rapid onset crystal-induced arthritis and is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. Characterised by intense pain and swelling, acute attacks typically affect the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint (MTP of the great toe). If chronic, gout may affect other mainly peripheral joints including ankles, knees and fingers amongst others. It is uncommon for gout to affect more central joints such as hips.
It is triggered following prolonged
hyperuricaemia
due to purine breakdown which results in the accumulation of
monosodium urate (MSU) crystals
in the joint. When aspirated, this synovial fluid can be viewed under polarizing light microscopy to confirm the diagnosis.
Gout most commonly affects men with a first attack experienced between the ages of 30 and 50. Increased alcohol intake, being obese, metabolic syndrome, being of African American origin and family history are all well-established risk factors.
Gout can cause incapacitation during an acute attack and many patients experience repeat attacks, although the frequency of these flares is reduced if a treatment plan is adhered to.
NSAIDs
or
colchicine
are first-line for an acute attack whilst
allopurinol
is used as first-line prophylaxis to reduce occurrence of flares.

Aetiology
Genetic Factors
While the precise genetic predisposition remains unclear, family history often plays a significant role in the susceptibility to hyperuricaemia and gout. Certain polymorphisms in the urate transporter genes have been implicated.
Dietary Factors
High intake of purine-rich foods (e.g., red meat, shellfish) and high-fructose beverages are associated with increased uric acid levels. Alcohol consumption, particularly beer, can exacerbate hyperuricaemia due to its purine content and diuretic effect.
Metabolic Syndrome
Hyperuricaemia is often found in tandem with components of the metabolic syndrome, including obesity, hypertension, and insulin resistance.
Renal Function
Impaired renal excretion of uric acid can contribute to hyperuricaemia. Conditions affecting renal function, such as chronic kidney disease, can thus predispose individuals to gout.
Medications
Thiazide diuretics, aspirin at low doses, and certain anti-tuberculosis medications can increase uric acid levels and precipitate gout.

Pathophysiology
Hyperuricaemia:
When uric acid levels exceed the solubility limit in plasma, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals may form. However, hyperuricaemia alone is not sufficient to cause gout, as many individuals with elevated uric acid levels do not develop the disease.
MSU Crystal Formation:
MSU crystals preferentially form in joints and soft tissues, particularly in cooler peripheral joints such as the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Conditions that alter the local environment, such as joint injury or osteoarthritis, can facilitate crystal deposition.
Inflammatory Response:
The presence of MSU crystals in the joints triggers an acute inflammatory response. Neutrophils are recruited to the site of deposition and phagocytose the crystals. This leads to the release of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and reactive oxygen species, causing the classical symptoms of gout: intense pain, redness, swelling, and warmth of the affected joint.
Chronic Gout:
Repeated episodes of acute gout can lead to chronic gouty arthritis, characterised by tophi formation, joint damage, and chronic pain. Tophi are nodules composed of MSU crystals surrounded by a chronic inflammatory reaction, and can develop in the soft tissues, cartilage, and bones.
Improve
Clinical features
The stereotypical presentation of gout is an acute monoarthritis, most commonly affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) — often referred to as podagra. The onset is typically abrupt, occurring over a few hours and characterised by severe pain, redness, swelling and tenderness of the affected joint.
In addition to the classic presentation of acute monoarthritis, there are various other clinical features that can be associated with gout:
Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia:
This refers to an elevated serum urate level without any clinical manifestations. Although it is not considered a disease state in itself, asymptomatic hyperuricaemia can progress to symptomatic gout if left untreated.
Acute polyarticular gout:
Although less common than monoarticular gout, this form can affect multiple joints simultaneously or sequentially. It is more likely to occur in patients with longstanding hyperuricaemia or those with co-morbid conditions such as renal impairment or cardiovascular disease.
Tophaceous gout:
This chronic stage of gout is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in soft tissues forming nodules known as tophi. Tophi are usually painless but can cause deformity and disability if they grow large or occur near joints. They may also ulcerate and discharge chalky material.
Gouty nephropathy:
Urate crystals may deposit in the renal tubules leading to interstitial nephritis and eventually chronic kidney disease. Patients may present with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria and hypertension.

Investigations
Diagnosing gout for the first time can be achieved primarily using
clinical features and patient history.
If clinical features do not confidently suggest gout, a
synovial fluid aspiration
of the affected joint will confirm the diagnosis.
It appropriate to arrange
serum uric acid measurements
4-6 weeks following the first presentation of suspected gout. They are also useful in
chronic gout
for monitoring purposes (higher levels correlate to a higher risk of gout). Additionally, radiology may evidence extra-articular features in chronic gout.
Investigations are outlined in more detail below.
Clinical diagnosis
NICE guidelines state that if a patient presents with features suggestive of gout and there are no suspicions of other conditions such as
septic arthritis
, a clinical diagnosis can be made with
no need for investigations.
The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommend that the clinical diagnosis be supported by the following features:
Mono-articular involvement of a foot/ankle joint
Previous episodes of a similar nature
Rapid onset
Erythema
Male
They stress that whilst
suggestive
of gout, these features are by no means specific.
If making a clinical diagnosis, screen for
cardiovascular risk
and risk of
kidney disease
.
Synovial fluid analysis
NICE advise aspiration is
not
indicated unless:
Diagnosis of gout is unsure.
Septic arthritis is suspected.
Fine-needle aspiration of the affected joint is considered the
gold standard
as the presence of MSU crystals is
100% specific
for gout. Usually, synovial fluid in gout will contain WBC at a level greater than 2000/µL
It can also be used to differentiate between gout and
pseudogout
.
Additionally, SF analysis allows the exclusion of an infective arthritis.

Serum uric acid
Hyperuricaemia is
NOT
diagnostic of gout however, increased levels do correlate with increased risk of developing gout.
Serum uric acid should be measured
4-6 weeks
following an acute gout attack to confirm hyperuricemia.
Serum uric acid reference ranges vary between trusts and so it would be advisable to look on the trust intranet to be certain. They tend to be around 200-430µmol/L in males and 140-360µmol/L in females.
It is considered to be
raised
when levels are above 360µmol/L
The absence of hyperuricaemia
does not exclude gout.
Given the correlation between higher serum uric acid levels and risk of gout, it can be useful in monitoring response to urate lowering therapy in a patient with chronic gout.

Radiology - useful in chronic gout
X-rays
X-rays are usually normal unless the disease is at an advanced stage.
In
chronic gout,
joint effusion is usually the earliest sign. Later, x-rays show
punched out lytic lesions
, sclerotic margins and outlines of
tophi
. Tophi are lumps caused by MSU crystal deposition.
Ultrasound:

Differential diagnosis
Pseudogout
(Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease, CPPD)
Clinical Presentation
Both gout and pseudogout can manifest as acute-onset monoarticular arthritis. While gout frequently affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint, pseudogout more commonly targets larger joints like the knee or wrist.
Diagnostic Investigations
Synovial fluid analysis remains the gold standard for diagnosis. In gout, one would find negatively birefringent, needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals. Conversely, in pseudogout, positively birefringent, rhomboid-shaped calcium pyrophosphate crystals are typical.
Imaging
Plain radiographs in chronic cases of pseudogout may show chondrocalcinosis, a finding absent in gout.
Management
Treatment of acute pseudogout often mirrors that of gout, with
NSAIDs
, corticosteroids, or colchicine. However, urate-lowering therapies effective in gout are not applicable to CPPD.
Septic Arthritis
Clinical Presentation
The sudden, severe onset of joint inflammation is common to both gout and septic arthritis. However, septic arthritis may present with accompanying fever and systemic malaise, which are less common in gout.
Diagnostic Investigations
Synovial fluid in septic arthritis typically demonstrates a high leukocyte count with neutrophil predominance. Gram stain and culture can identify the causative organism.
Imaging
While both conditions can result in joint space narrowing and erosion in chronic stages, early septic arthritis may display soft tissue swelling and effusion without the focal erosions frequently seen in chronic gout.
Management
Septic arthritis requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic treatment, tailored to the isolated organism, making it crucial to differentiate from gout.
Improve
Management
Gout is typically managed in the community setting with differing approaches for acute and chronic gout. The goal of treatment to manage an acute attack is to
reduce pain and inflammation
of the affected joint and ensure its function is rapidly restored, whilst long-term management of gout aims to
prevent flares and reduce joint erosion
.
NICE guidelines for the management of gout are based upon the European League Against Rheumatism's (EULAR) evidence-based recommendations. Management of an acute attack includes
NSAIDs
and colchicine as first-line agents and corticosteroids if NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated. Long-term control includes lifestyle advice and a range of pharmacological options but most commonly serum urate-lowering therapy
allopurinol
as first-line and febuxostat if allopurinol is not tolerated.
Acute management
NSAIDs or
colchicine
are first-line
the maximum dose of NSAID should be prescribed until 1-2 days after the symptoms have settled
gastroprotection (e.g. a proton pump inhibitor) may also be indicated
colchicine
inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin, interfering with mitosis. Also inhibits neutrophil motility and activity
has a slower onset of action
may be used with caution in renal impairment
: the BNF advises to reduce the dose if eGFR is 10-50 ml/min and to avoid if eGFR < 10 ml/min
BNF
the main side-effect is
diarrhoea
oral steroids
may be considered if NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated.
a dose of prednisolone 15mg/day is usually used
another option is intra-articular steroid injection
if the patient is already taking allopurinol it should be continued
Indications for urate-lowering therapy (ULT)
the British Society of
Rheumatology
Guidelines now advocate offering
urate-lowering therapy to all patients after their
first attack of gout
ULT is
particularly
recommended if:
>= 2 attacks in 12 months
tophi
renal disease
uric acid renal stones
prophylaxis if on cytotoxics or diuretics
Urate-lowering therapy
it has traditionally been taught that urate-lowering therapy should not be started until 2 weeks after an acute attack, as starting too early may precipitate a further attack. The evidence base to support this however looks weak
in 2017 the BSR updated their guidelines. They still support a delay in starting urate-lowering therapy because it is better for a patient to make long-term drug decisions whilst not in pain
the key passage is:
'Commencement of ULT is best delayed until inflammation has settled as ULT is better discussed when the patient is not in pain'
allopurinol is first-line
initial dose of 100 mg od, with the dose titrated every few weeks to aim for a serum uric acid of < 360 µmol/l
CKS
a lower target uric acid level below 300 µmol/L may be considered for patients who have tophi, chronic gouty arthritis or continue to have ongoing frequent flares despite having a uric acid below 360 µmol/L
a lower initial dose of allopurinol should be given if the patient has a reduced eGFR
colchicine cover
should be considered when starting allopurinol.
NSAIDs
can be used if colchicine cannot be tolerated. The BSR guidelines suggest this may need to be continued for 6 months
the second-line agent when allopurinol is not tolerated or ineffective is febuxostat (also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor)
in refractory cases other agents may be tried:
uricase (urate oxidase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of urate to the degradation product allantoin. It is present in certain mammals but not humans
in patients who have persistent symptomatic and severe gout despite the adequate use of urate-lowering therapy, pegloticase (polyethylene glycol modified mammalian uricase) can achieve rapid control of hyperuricemia. It is given as an infusion once every two weeks
Lifestyle modifications
reduce alcohol intake and avoid during an acute attack
lose weight if obese
avoid food high in purines e.g. Liver, kidneys, seafood, oily fish (mackerel, sardines) and yeast products
Other points
consideration should be given to stopping precipitating drugs (such as
thiazides
)
losartan has a specific uricosuric action and may be particularly suitable for the many patients who have coexistent hypertension
increased vitamin C intake (either supplements or through normal diet) may also decrease serum uric acid levels
Improve
Complications
If gout is not well controlled, it may result in the development of a range of co-morbidities/presentations. Many of these are a result of the chronically elevated levels of serum uric acid and subsequent systemic effects.
Complications include:
Tophi
As mentioned previously, tophi form when MSU crystals deposit to form hard lumps. They can form in tissues, bone and cartilage and if large and painful may impact a patients ability to perform daily tasks.
Tophi are usually a sign of
chronic gout
, their presence indicates that there are likely to be MSU crystal deposits elsewhere in the body.
Bone complications
Repeated attacks of gout and the presence of tophi all contribute to bone erosion and weakening of joints resulting in
degenerative arthritis
. In the most serious of cases, surgery will be required to rectify this damage.
A 2018 population-based study found that gout conferred a
20% increased risk of osteoporosis.
Renal complications
Kidney stones may occur due to deposits of MSU crystals in the urinary tract as a result of hyperuricaemia. They can disrupt the flow of urine, cause pain and make the patient more susceptible to an infection of the urinary tract or kidney.
Although kidney disease is a risk factor for gout, gout can also
cause
kidney disease. Although not fully understood, it is believed kidney disease may result due to the passage of MSU crystals through kidneys causing scarring. This scarring then reduces functionality of the kidneys.
Mental health conditions
Resultant from the chronic pain and incapacitation, patients may be unable to work of complete activities of daily living.
Cumulatively, this may impact a patient's mental well-being and they should be supported appropriately.
Many of these complications can be avoided if serum uric acid levels are kept within range.
