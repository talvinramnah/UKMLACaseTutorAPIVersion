Still's disease in adults
Still's disease in adults
Still's disease in adults is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder that can present with a variety of symptoms, including
fever
,
rash
,
joint pain
, and organ involvement. The diagnosis of Still's disease is often challenging due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and the absence of specific laboratory tests. However, the use of diagnostic criteria, such as the Yamaguchi criteria, can aid in the diagnosis of Still's disease. Treatment options for Still's disease include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Biologic agents, such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 inhibitors, have also shown promise in the treatment of refractory cases. Close monitoring of disease activity and potential complications, such as macrophage activation syndrome, is essential in the management of Still's disease.

and serositis
they should be trialled for at least a week before steroids are added.
