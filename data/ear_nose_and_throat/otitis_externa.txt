Otitis externa
Otitis externa
Otitis externa, commonly referred to as swimmer's ear, is an inflammatory condition affecting the external auditory canal and pinna. It can be classified into acute or chronic, with the former lasting less than six weeks while the latter persists beyond three months. The aetiology of otitis externa encompasses infectious agents (bacterial or fungal), allergic reactions, and dermatologic disorders such as eczema or seborrhoeic dermatitis.
The clinical presentation typically includes pruritus,
otalgia
, otorrhea, aural fullness or
hearing loss
, and erythematous oedematous ear canal. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings; however, microbiological evaluation via culture may be necessary in refractory or recurrent cases.
Management involves addressing predisposing factors alongside topical antimicrobial therapy: antibiotic eardrops for bacterial infections (e.g., fluoroquinolones) and antifungal eardrops for fungal infections (e.g., clotrimazole). In severe cases with significant inflammation or oedema causing occlusion of the external auditory canal, a wick may be inserted to facilitate medication delivery. Systemic antibiotics should be reserved for complicated cases with cellulitis extending beyond the external auditory canal or signs of systemic infection.

Pathophysiology
Causes of otitis externa include:
infection
bacterial:
Staphylococcus aureus
,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
fungal: primarily caused by
Aspergillus
species and
Candida albicans
, are more prevalent in chronic cases
seborrhoeic dermatitis
contact dermatitis (allergic and irritant)

Clinical features
Features
ear pain
ear itch
ear discharge
Otoscopy findings:
view may be limited secondary to discharge, debris or swelling
red, swollen, or eczematous canal
Improve
Management
The recommended initial management of otitis externa is:
topical antibiotic or a combined topical antibiotic with a steroid
if the tympanic membrane is perforated aminoglycosides are traditionally not used*
if there is canal debris then consider removal
if the canal is extensively swollen then an ear wick is sometimes inserted
Second-line options include
consider contact dermatitis secondary to neomycin
oral antibiotics (flucloxacillin) if the infection is spreading
taking a swab inside the ear canal
empirical use of an antifungal agent
*many ENT doctors disagree with this and feel that concerns about ototoxicity are unfounded

Complications
Malignant otitis externa
is more common in elderly diabetics. In this condition, there is extension of infection into the bony ear canal and the soft tissues deep to the bony canal. Intravenous antibiotics may be required.
