Leukoplakia
Leukoplakia
Leukoplakia is a premalignant condition which presents as white, hard spots on the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is more common in smokers.
Leukoplakia is said to be a diagnosis of exclusion. Candidiasis and lichen planus should be considered, especially if the lesions can be 'rubbed off'
Biopsies are usually performed to exclude alternative diagnoses such as squamous cell carcinoma and regular follow-up is required to exclude malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs in around 1% of patients.

Clinical features
Leukoplakia, a potentially malignant oral lesion, is characterized by the presence of white patches or plaques on the mucosal surfaces. The clinical features of leukoplakia can be broadly categorized into appearance, location, and associated symptoms.
Leukoplakic lesions typically present as well-defined, irregularly shaped white patches or plaques with varying surface characteristics. The colour may range from pale white to greyish-white and may have a translucent or opaque quality. Based on their surface texture, leukoplakia can be classified into three types:
Homogeneous Leukoplakia: This type presents as uniformly flat and thin lesions with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It is considered to have a lower risk of malignant transformation compared to other subtypes.
Non-homogeneous Leukoplakia: This subtype exhibits an irregular appearance with areas of redness (erythroplasia) intermixed with white patches (speckled leukoplakia). The surface may be nodular, exophytic, or verrucous. Non-homogeneous leukoplakia carries a higher risk for malignant transformation.
Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia: This rare form is characterized by multiple slow-growing verrucous plaques that eventually become confluent and infiltrative. It has a high propensity for malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma.
Leukoplakic lesions can involve any site within the oral cavity but are most commonly found on the buccal mucosa, gingiva, tongue (particularly lateral borders), and floor of the mouth. They are less frequently observed on the palate and lips. In some cases, leukoplakia may also affect extraoral sites such as larynx, oesophagus, and genital mucosa.
Leukoplakia is usually asymptomatic, and patients often present with an incidental finding during routine dental examinations. However, some individuals may report mild discomfort or irritation at the site of the lesion, particularly in cases of non-homogeneous leukoplakia with a rough or nodular surface texture.
It is essential to differentiate leukoplakia from other white lesions of the oral cavity such as candidiasis, lichen planus, frictional keratosis, and oral hairy leukoplakia through thorough clinical examination and histopathological evaluation.

Management
Risk Factor Modification:
Smoking Cessation: Encourage patients to quit smoking through counselling, nicotine replacement therapy or pharmacological interventions.
Alcohol Reduction: Advise patients on reducing alcohol intake within recommended limits.
Biopsies are usually performed to exclude alternative diagnoses such as squamous cell carcinoma and regular follow-up is required to exclude malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs in around 1% of patients.
There are no clear guidelines for managing leukoplakia. Surgical excision is usually performed using traditional surgical techniques, laser ablation, or cryotherapy.
