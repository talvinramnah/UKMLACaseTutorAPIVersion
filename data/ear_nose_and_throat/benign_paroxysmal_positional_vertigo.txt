Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
Benign paroxysmal positional
vertigo
(BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo encountered. It is characterised by the sudden onset of dizziness and vertigo triggered by changes in head position. The average age of onset is 55 years and it is less common in younger patients.

Clinical features
Features
vertigo
triggered by change in head position (e.g. rolling over in bed or gazing upwards)
may be associated with
nausea
each episode typically lasts 10-20 seconds
positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre

Management
BPPV has a good prognosis and usually resolves spontaneously after a few weeks to months. Symptomatic relief may be gained by:
Epley manoeuvre
(successful in around 80% of cases)
teaching the patient exercises they can do themselves at home, termed vestibular rehabilitation, for example Brandt-Daroff exercises
Medication is often prescribed (e.g. Betahistine) but it tends to be of limited value.

Prognosis
Natural History
BPPV is generally a
self-limiting condition
with approximately 20-30% of cases resolving spontaneously within 1 month and up to 50% within 3 months without treatment
However, recurrence is common, with 15-50% of patients experiencing a relapse within 1-5 years after the initial episode
Recurrence rates are higher in older patients and those with secondary BPPV (e.g. post-traumatic)
The posterior canal is most commonly affected in recurrent cases, though canal involvement may change between episodes
Treatment Outcomes
Canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs) such as the Epley manoeuvre significantly improve prognosis
Single Epley manoeuvre resolves symptoms in approximately 80% of patients after one session
Success rates increase to >90% with repeated procedures
NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary
recommends CRPs as first-line treatment due to their high efficacy and safety profile
Untreated BPPV is associated with increased risk of falls, particularly in the elderly population
This risk is substantially reduced following successful treatment
Long-term Considerations
Persistent or frequently recurring BPPV may lead to:
Avoidance behaviours and activity limitation
Increased anxiety and reduced quality of life
Higher healthcare utilisation
Factors associated with poorer prognosis include:
Advanced age (>70 years)
Multiple canal involvement
Secondary BPPV (particularly post-traumatic)
Coexisting vestibular disorders
No evidence suggests that BPPV leads to permanent vestibular damage or neurological sequelae
