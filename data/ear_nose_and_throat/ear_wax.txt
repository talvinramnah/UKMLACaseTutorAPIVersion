Ear wax is a normal physiological substance which helps protect the ear canal. Impacted ear wax is extremely common.

Clinical features
Typical Presentation
Ear wax impaction typically presents with a sensation of ear blockage or fullness, often unilateral but can be bilateral
Patients commonly report reduced hearing in the affected ear(s), which may develop gradually or suddenly if water exposure causes wax to swell
Most cases of impacted ear wax are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during otoscopy
Common Symptoms
Conductive
hearing loss
- usually mild to moderate, proportional to the degree of canal occlusion
Tinnitus
- typically low-pitched and may resolve with wax removal
Earache
(otalgia) - usually mild discomfort rather than severe pain
Sensation of "fullness" or pressure in the ear
Itching of the external auditory canal
May be exacerbated by patient's attempts to clean the ear with cotton buds or other objects
Vertigo
or imbalance - uncommon but can occur if wax is pressing against the tympanic membrane
Usually mild and transient
Physical Examination Findings
Otoscopy reveals yellow-brown or dark brown waxy material in the external auditory canal
May be soft and moist or hard and dry in consistency
Complete occlusion of the canal prevents visualisation of the tympanic membrane
Varying degrees of canal occlusion may be seen:
Partial occlusion - tympanic membrane partially visible
Complete occlusion - no view of tympanic membrane possible
Occasionally, secondary signs of external ear canal inflammation may be present if attempts at self-cleaning have caused trauma
Erythema, oedema or excoriation of the canal
Weber and Rinne tests may demonstrate a conductive hearing loss pattern in the affected ear
Weber test lateralising to the affected ear
Negative Rinne test on the affected side

Management
The main treatment options in primary care are ear drops or irrigation ('ear syringing'). Treatment should not be given if a perforation is suspected. The following drops may be used:
olive oil
sodium bicarbonate 5%
almond oil
