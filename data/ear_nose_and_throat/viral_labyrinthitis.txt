Viral labyrinthitis is an inflammatory condition of the inner ear, specifically affecting the labyrinth, which comprises the vestibular system and the cochlea. It is characterized by a sudden onset of
vertigo
,
hearing loss
, and tinnitus, typically following a viral infection.

Pathophysiology
Viral labyrinthitis is usually caused by a viral infection that spreads from the respiratory tract or middle ear to the inner ear. The most common viral pathogens implicated include herpesviruses, mumps, influenza, and enteroviruses. The inflammation leads to dysfunction of the vestibular system, resulting in
vertigo
and balance disturbances, as well as the cochlea, causing
hearing loss
and tinnitus.

Clinical features
The primary symptoms of viral labyrinthitis include:
Vertigo
:
Patients typically experience a sudden, severe vertigo that can last for days to weeks. The vertigo may be accompanied by
nausea
,
vomiting
, and difficulties in maintaining balance.
Hearing loss
:
Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly observed, which may be unilateral or bilateral. The degree of hearing loss can range from mild to severe.
Tinnitus:
Patients often report a persistent ringing or buzzing sound in the affected ear(s).
There may also be preceding or concurrent symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.
Signs of labyrinthitis:
spontaneous unidirectional horizontal
nystagmus
towards the unaffected side
sensorineural hearing loss: shown by Rinne's test and Weber test
abnormal head impulse test: signifies an impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex
gait disturbance: the patient may fall towards the affected side

Management
episodes are usually self-limiting
prochlorperazine or antihistamines may help reduce the sensation of dizziness
