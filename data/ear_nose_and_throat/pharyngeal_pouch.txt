Pharyngeal pouch
Pharyngeal pouch
A pharyngeal pouch (also known as a Zenker's diverticulum) is an outpouching of the pharyngeal mucosa through an area of muscular weakness at the posterior pharyngeal wall called Killian's dehiscence. It is a type of oesophageal diverticulum, which is an umbrella term also including midthoracic diverticula and epiphrenic diverticula.
Pharyngeal pouches occur in 1 in 200,000 people in the UK and typically affect older males. They are an important cause of
dysphagia
and are often associated with regurgitation, cough and
halitosis

Aetiology
- It is not known why some people develop pharyngeal pouches whilst others do not, however, some proposed mechanisms include:
Uncoordinated swallowing
Impaired relaxation of the cricopharyngeus muscle leading to increased pressure in the distal pharynx
Anatomical predisposition to larger Killian's dehiscence
Common risk factors
include:
Older age: pharyngeal pouches are uncommon under the age of 40, and most commonly occur in the seventh decade of life or later
Male sex: pharyngeal pouches are 5 times more common in men
Positive family history: this may be related to having an anatomically larger Killian's dehiscence
Improve
Pathophysiology
- A pharyngeal pouch is formed when pharyngeal mucosa herniates through a weak area of the posterior pharyngeal wall
This area is known as the Killian's dehiscence and is located between the cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus muscles (the muscles which form the upper oesophageal sphincter)
Over time, excessive pressure within the lower pharynx, caused by swallowing, can result in ballooning of the pharyngeal mucosa through Killian's dissidence, forming a pharyngeal pouch
Uncoordinated swallowing may contribute to this excessive pressure
A pharyngeal pouch may be several centimetres in diameter and grow over time
The pouch is known as a pseudodiverticulum as it does not involve all layers of the oesophageal wall

Clinical features
- A pharyngeal pouch may be asymptomatic, however,  patients typically present with:
Dysphagia
(85%)
Regurgitation of food (40%)
Cough and aspiration (35%)
Halitosis
Neck swelling
Gurgling sound when swallowing
Weight loss due to eating difficulties
Physical examination findings may include:
A neck swelling which gurgles on palpation (Boyce's sign)
Signs of weight loss and/or malnutrition
Symptoms may develop over weeks or years and tend to worsen as the pharyngeal pouch grows larger
Sudden worsening of dysphagia and/or presence of haemoptysis may suggest malignancy within the pouch and should be investigated using a 2-week wait referral
Improve
Investigations
- Patients presenting with
dysphagia
are referred for an
oesophagoduodenoscopy (OGD)
as an initial investigation
An OGD may be able to identify and assess the extent of a pharyngeal pouch if it is present
A
barium swallow test
is the gold standard investigation to confirm the presence of a pharyngeal pouch
A barium swallow test is also known as oesophagram and is often performed after an OGD if a pharyngeal pouch is suspected
The patient swallows liquid barium sulphate whilst X-ray images are taken
The barium will pool in the pharyngeal pouch and not move between films, as a food bolus would
This confirms the presence of a pharyngeal pouch

Differential diagnosis
The symptoms of a pharyngeal pouch can also be caused by many other pharyngeal and oesophageal conditions.
Possible differential diagnoses:
Gastro-oesophageal reflux
(
GORD
)
Similarities: both may cause
dysphagia
, regurgitation and cough
Differences: GORD is more common and does not cause neck swelling or a gurgling sound
Diffuse oesophageal spasm
Similarities: both may cause dysphagia and regurgitation
Differences: the main presenting symptom of oesophageal spasm is often chest pain; neck swelling is not a feature
Oropharyngeal carcinoma
Similarities: both may cause dysphagia, regurgitation and weight loss; increasing age and male sex are risk factors for both
Differences: haemoptysis and local pain are alarm symptoms for oropharyngeal carcinoma, and there is typically a history of smoking and/or excessive alcohol consumption
Oesophageal achalasia
Similarities: both may cause dysphagia
Differences: achalasia typically causes retrosternal pain

Management
All patients with symptoms of a pharyngeal pouch should be referred to
Ear, Nose and Throat
(ENT) for assessment and management.
The mainstay management of a pharyngeal pouch is
surgery
, however, in patients with mild symptoms or those unable to have surgery, a
'watch-and-wait'
approach may be more appropriate.
In 2015 NICE published guidelines on the surgical techniques approved for the management of pharyngeal pouch
Traditionally, open surgery is performed and the pouch is completely removed (called a diverticulectomy)
Endoscopic techniques using rigid endoscopes are now preferred to open surgery as they are quicker, less invasive, more cost-effective and tend to have a shorter recovery time
During endoscopic surgery, the pharyngeal pouch may be treated using a diathermy laser or stapling technique
Current guidelines recommend that open surgery should only be performed after 2 failed endoscopic surgeries, or if patients have any contraindications to endoscopic surgery, such as poor mobility of the cervical spine due to osteoarthritis

Complications
-
Malnutrition
Clinical malnutrition may be identified in up to 31% of patients with a pharyngeal pouch and is likely a result of
dysphagia
Aspiration pneumonia
Up to 12% of patients with a pharyngeal pouch may develop an aspiration pneumonia
Small increased risk of
squamous cell carcinoma
within the pouch
This is a rare but important complication (reported incidence of up to 1.1%)
It is thought to be due to chronic inflammation of the mucosa within the pouch over time
