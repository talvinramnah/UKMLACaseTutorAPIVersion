Inhaled foreign body
Inhaled foreign body
Inhaled foreign body is a common occurrence in both children and adults. It can lead to serious complications such as airway obstruction, pneumonia, and even death. The most common objects that are inhaled include food particles, toys, and small household items. Patients may present with symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing
Imaging studies such as chest X-rays and CT scans can also aid in identifying the foreign body. Treatment options include bronchoscopy, which is the preferred method for removal of the foreign body.

Aetiology
Commonly aspirated objects include food particles (e.g., nuts, seeds), small toys (e.g., beads), and organic materials (e.g., teeth). The right bronchial system is more frequently involved than the left due to its more vertical orientation.

Pathophysiology
The clinical manifestations of IFBs depend on the size, shape, composition, location of the object, and host response. Aspiration can lead to mechanical obstruction of airflow resulting in atelectasis distal to the obstruction site or air trapping proximally with subsequent hyperinflation. Additionally, inflammatory reactions may develop around the foreign body leading to granulation tissue formation and potential infection.

Clinical features
The classic triad of coughing paroxysms, wheezing, and decreased breath sounds may be present but is not universally observed in all patients with IFBs. The following clinical features can be seen:
Sudden onset choking or gagging
Coughing paroxysms
Stridor
(if located above vocal cords)
Wheezing or asymmetric breath sounds
Decreased air entry on auscultation
Cyanosis or respiratory distress
Tachypnoea and tachycardia
