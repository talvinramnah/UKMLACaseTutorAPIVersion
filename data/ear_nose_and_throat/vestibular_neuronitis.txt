and imbalance.

Pathophysiology
Vestibular neuronitis is thought to be primarily caused by a viral infection, leading to inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the inner ear to the brain. The most commonly implicated viruses include herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The inflammation disrupts the normal functioning of the vestibular nerve, resulting in
vertigo
and balance disturbances.

Clinical features
The primary symptoms of vestibular neuronitis include:
Vertigo
:
Patients typically experience a sudden onset of severe, persistent vertigo that can last for days to weeks. The vertigo may be accompanied by
nausea
,
vomiting
, and difficulty maintaining balance.
Imbalance:
Patients often report a sense of unsteadiness or imbalance, which may lead to difficulties walking or performing daily activities.
Nystagmus
:
A spontaneous, unidirectional, horizontal nystagmus is frequently observed in affected patients.
Unlike
viral labyrinthitis
, vestibular neuronitis does not involve the cochlea, and therefore, hearing loss and tinnitus are not common symptoms.

Management
Management
buccal or intramuscular prochlorperazine is often used to provide rapid relief for severe cases
a short oral course of prochlorperazine, or an antihistamine (cinnarizine, cyclizine, or promethazine) may be used to alleviate less severe cases
vestibular rehabilitation exercises are the preferred treatment for patients who experience chronic symptoms
