Acute sinusitis
Acute sinusitis
Acute sinusitis, also known as acute rhinosinusitis, is an inflammatory condition involving the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, typically lasting less than four weeks. The most common aetiology is
viral upper respiratory tract infections
(URTI), with only 1-2% progressing to bacterial infection.
Streptococcus pneumoniae
,
Haemophilus influenzae
, and
Moraxella catarrhalis
are the predominant bacterial pathogens involved.
Clinical manifestations include nasal congestion, purulent
rhinorrhoea
,
facial pain
or pressure, and
anosmia
.
Fever
may be present in bacterial cases. Diagnosis is primarily clinical.
Management involves symptomatic relief with analgesics, decongestants, intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation. Antibiotics are reserved for patients with severe symptoms or those who fail to improve after 7-10 days of conservative management.
Complications of acute sinusitis include orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess formation and intracranial extension leading to meningitis or brain abscesses.

Pathophysiology
The sinuses are usually sterile - the most common infectious agents seen in acute sinusitis are
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
,
Haemophilus influenzae
and rhinoviruses.
Predisposing factors include:
nasal obstruction
e.g. Septal deviation or nasal polyps
recent local infection e.g. Rhinitis or dental extraction
swimming/diving
smoking

Clinical features
Typical Presentation
Acute sinusitis typically presents with nasal congestion and discharge,
facial pain
or pressure, and reduced sense of smell lasting less than 4 weeks
Most cases follow a viral
upper respiratory tract infection
with symptoms persisting beyond 7-10 days, or worsening after initial improvement ("double-sickening")
Patients often report symptoms worsening when bending forward or lying down
Symptoms are usually bilateral, though unilateral symptoms may suggest bacterial infection or other pathology
Specific Symptoms
Nasal symptoms
are prominent and include:
Nasal congestion or obstruction
Purulent (discoloured)
nasal discharge
- anterior or posterior
Hyposmia or
anosmia
(reduced or absent sense of smell)
Facial pain and pressure
typically affects the following areas:
Maxillary sinusitis: cheeks, upper teeth, and infraorbital region
Frontal sinusitis: forehead and supraorbital region
Ethmoid sinusitis: between and behind the eyes, often with periorbital oedema
Sphenoid sinusitis: vertex of head, occiput, or retro-orbital region
Systemic symptoms
may include:
Fever
(more common in bacterial sinusitis)
Fatigue and malaise
Cough
(often worse at night due to postnasal drip)
Halitosis
Features Suggesting Complications
Red flag symptoms
requiring urgent assessment include:
Periorbital oedema, erythema, or visual disturbance
Severe headache, altered mental status, or focal neurological signs
Frontal swelling or severe frontal headache
Symptoms persisting beyond 3 months (suggesting chronic sinusitis)
NICE guidance
recommends immediate referral to hospital for patients with sinusitis who develop signs of orbital or intracranial complications

Management
Management of acute sinusitis
analgesia
intranasal decongestants or nasal saline may be considered but the evidence supporting these is limited
NICE recommend that intranasal corticosteroids may be considered if the symptoms have been present for more than 10 days
oral antibiotics are not normally required but may be given for severe presentations. The BNF recommends phenoxymethylpenicillin first-line, co-amoxiclav if 'systemically very unwell, signs and symptoms of a more serious illness, or at high-risk of complications'
