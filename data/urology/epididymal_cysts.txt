Epididymal cysts
Epididymal cysts
Epididymal cysts are common benign masses that occur in the epididymis, which is a coiled tube located behind the testicle. These cysts are usually painless and can be detected during a routine physical exam or ultrasound. They are more commonly found in men over the age of 40 and are typically small, measuring less than 2 cm in diameter.
In most cases, epididymal cysts do not require treatment and can be monitored with regular follow-up exams. However, if the cyst becomes large or causes discomfort, surgical removal may be necessary. It is important to differentiate epididymal cysts from other testicular masses, such as testicular cancer, through proper evaluation and imaging studies.

Clinical features
Epididymal cysts are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally during routine physical examination or imaging studies.
However, they can cause discomfort or pain if they grow large enough to put pressure on surrounding structures. The presenting features of epididymal cysts may include:
A painless, smooth, and firm mass located in the epididymis
Found posterior to the testicle
Separate from the body of the testicle
Discomfort or pain may occasionally be felt
A feeling of heaviness or dragging sensation in the scrotum.
Rarely, infection or inflammation of the cyst may occur, leading to redness, warmth, tenderness, and fever

Management
When epididymal cysts become symptomatic or cause complications, appropriate management strategies are crucial for alleviating patient discomfort and preventing further issues.
Conservative Management:
Observation: In cases where the epididymal cyst is small, asymptomatic, and not causing any discomfort to the patient, a conservative approach with regular follow-up examinations can be employed. Patients should be counselled on self-examination techniques to monitor for changes in size or the development of symptoms.
Scrotal support: For patients experiencing mild discomfort due to the presence of an epididymal cyst, scrotal support using well-fitted underwear or a scrotal sling may provide relief by reducing tension on the spermatic cord structures.
Interventional Management:
Aspiration and sclerotherapy: If conservative management fails to alleviate symptoms or if the cyst significantly increases in size over time (>5cm), aspiration followed by sclerotherapy may be considered. Under ultrasound guidance and after infiltration of local anaesthesia, a fine needle is inserted into the cyst to aspirate its contents. A sclerosing agent (e.g., polidocanol) is then injected into the cyst cavity to induce fibrosis and prevent reaccumulation of fluid. However, this procedure carries a risk of recurrence, infection, and injury to the epididymis.
Surgical excision: In cases where aspiration and sclerotherapy are contraindicated or have failed to provide relief, surgical excision of the cyst may be performed. This can be done through an inguinal or scrotal approach under general or regional anaesthesia. The surgeon isolates the cyst from the surrounding structures and removes it while preserving the integrity of the epididymis and testis. Potential complications include haematoma formation, infection, injury to adjacent structures (e.g., vas deferens), hydrocele formation, and recurrence.
