Acute pyelonephritis
Acute pyelonephritis
Acute pyelonephritis is an infection of one or both of the kidneys. It occurs as a result of an ascending
urinary tract infection
(
UTI
) which has spread from the bladder up towards the kidneys. It is usually caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract through the urethra.
Whilst lower UTIs are very common, pyelonephritis is much rarer. However, it is an important diagnosis to make because if left untreated it can lead to serious complications and irreversible kidney damage.

Aetiology
Many organisms can cause acute pyelonephritis however the most common are gram negative bacteria:
Escherichia coli
(80%)
Klebsiella species
Proteus mirabilis
Pseudomonas species
(more common in hospital acquired infections)
Enterobacter species
In rare cases, fungi (most commonly
Candida species
) can cause pyelonephritis. This is usually seen in patients with nephrostomy tubes, patients who are immunocompromised, etc.
A number of factors increase the risk of infection:
Female sex
Women's urethras are shorter than men's, so it's easier for bacteria to enter
Factors that reduce the flow of urine (if urine cannot flow properly, it becomes stagnant allowing bacteria to multiply rapidly)
Stones, BPH, tract abnormalities
Spinal cord injuries leading to a neuropathic bladder
Retrograde ascent of bacteria
Vesico-ureteric reflux- a condition where urine from the bladder flows backwards into the ureters and kidneys
Catheter use
Pregnancy
Immunosuppression
Diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid use, cancer, HIV, etc

Pathophysiology
Bacterial Pathogenesis
Most cases of APN are caused by uropathogenic
Escherichia coli
, but other pathogens like
Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterococcus
, and
Staphylococcus saprophyticus
can also be implicated.
Escherichia coli
has specific virulence factors that allow it to ascend the urinary tract. These include fimbriae (pili), which facilitate adhesion to uroepithelial cells; flagella, which enable bacterial motility; and the production of haemolysin and cytotoxic necrotizing factor, causing cell injury and promoting bacterial invasion.
P-fimbriated
E. coli
strains, in particular, are able to bind to glycosphingolipid receptors on uroepithelial cells, leading to bacterial colonization and formation of biofilms. Bacteria can also invade uroepithelial cells and multiply intracellularly, forming intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) which can resist host immune responses and antibiotic treatment.
Host Responses
The host's immune response plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of APN. The initial response to bacterial invasion involves the release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by renal tubular cells.
These molecules recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection, leading to the classic symptoms of pyelonephritis -
fever
,
flank pain
, and leukocytosis. Neutrophils are particularly essential in controlling bacterial growth, while macrophages and natural killer cells help to limit the spread of infection.
However, excessive or prolonged inflammation can result in tissue damage, leading to scarring and potentially loss of renal function. In severe cases, inflammation can extend beyond the renal capsule, resulting in perinephric abscesses, pyonephrosis, and urosepsis.

Clinical features
Symptoms of pyelonephritis typically develop quickly; usually over a couple of days.
Most commonly:
Fever
(77%)
Nausea
and
vomiting
Flank pain
, usually unilateral (86%)
Other symptoms include:
Haematuria
This may require further investigation as it could be a sign of cancer- bladder, renal or prostate cancer in men.
Consider a 2-week wait referral for urological cancers
Foul-smelling urine
Malaise
Diarrhoea
Confusion
Clinical findings-
Tenderness over the loin area
Signs of shock
Urosepsis is a life-threatening complication of pyelonephritis and can lead to septic shock. Signs include
hypotension
tachypnoea, skin changes, oliguria
It is important to note that the presentation can differ between age groups:
Young children may have non-specific symptoms such as a fever, irritability and poor feeding
Elderly patients may present with increased confusion or new incontinence.

Investigations
First-line investigations for suspected acute pyelonephritis include:
Urinalysis
: Perform a dipstick test to check for the presence of nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and
haematuria
. These findings can indicate a
urinary tract infection
(
UTI
), which is often associated with acute pyelonephritis.
Urine culture and sensitivity
: Obtain a midstream urine sample for culture to identify the causative organism, commonly *Escherichia coli*, and determine its antibiotic sensitivities. This guides appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
Blood tests
: Conduct full blood count (FBC) to assess white blood cell (WBC) count, which may be elevated in infection. Measure C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as they are typically elevated in inflammatory processes. Urea and electrolytes (U&Es) should also be checked to assess renal function.
Blood cultures
: If the patient presents with systemic symptoms such as
fever
or rigors, obtain blood cultures to rule out bacteraemia or sepsis.
If initial investigations suggest acute pyelonephritis but there is uncertainty about the diagnosis or if the patient does not respond to initial treatment, further investigations may be warranted:
Imaging studies
:
Ultrasound of the kidneys
: Recommended in cases where there is suspicion of an obstructed urinary tract or if the patient has recurrent infections. It helps identify structural abnormalities, abscesses, or hydronephrosis.
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis without contrast
: Considered when ultrasound results are inconclusive or if there is suspicion of complications such as abscess formation or emphysematous pyelonephritis. A CT scan provides detailed imaging of renal anatomy and surrounding structures.
Further urine tests
: In specific cases where atypical pathogens are suspected, additional testing such as mycobacterial cultures may be required.
Cystoscopy and urodynamic studies
: Indicated in patients with recurrent UTIs or anatomical abnormalities that might predispose them to infections. These procedures help evaluate bladder function and detect any structural issues within the lower urinary tract.
Nuclear medicine scans
: DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan can be used occasionally in paediatric patients to assess renal scarring from recurrent infections but is rarely indicated in adults unless there are complex diagnostic challenges.
The majority of cases can be diagnosed based on clinical presentation supported by urinalysis and urine culture results without extensive additional investigations. Imaging studies are reserved for complicated cases or when an atypical presentation occurs.

Differential diagnosis
There are a wide range of differentials that need to be considered before a diagnosis of pyelonephritis can be made. These include the following-
Simple
UTI
(lower urinary tract infected)
Suprapubic pain, frequency and
dysuria
are more common in a simple infection, pain is less severe
Fevers usually more pronounced in pyelonephritis
Systemic systems such a malaise are more common in pyelonephritis
Causes of an acute abdomen
Examples include appendicitis, diverticulitis, acute pancreatitis
Costovertebral/
flank pain
more likely in pyelonephritis
Guarding not usually a feature of pyelonephritis
Nausea
and
vomiting
can be a feature of both
Abdominal
aortic aneurysm
(AAA)
Can also present with back pain
Pulsatile abdominal mass may be felt in an AAA
Ultrasound can be used for initial assessment to detect an AAA
Gynaecological causes
Ectopic pregnancy, endometritis
Ensure all relevant patients have a pregnancy test and take a detailed gynae history if appropriate
Costovertebral angle pain less common
Lower lobe pneumonia
Consider if respiratory symptoms are present
Improve
Management
The mainstay of treatment of acute pyelonephritis is antibiotics. Empirical antibiotics should be started
after
urine cultures have been taken. These can later be tailored once the sensitivities are available.
Other treatments to consider:
IV fluids
Analgesia
Antiemetics if required
NICE offers guidelines for the use of catheters in patients with symptoms of pyelonephritis-
Remove if possible
Ensure catheters are correctly positioned, drain correctly and are not blocked.
Catheter change in patients with a long term catheter if it has been in place for more than 7 days
Patients can often be managed with oral antibiotics (7-10 day course usually required) in the community but hospital admission should be considered in the following circumstances-
Pregnant woman
Patients who are not improving in the community despite 48 hours of treatment
Severe pain
Patients with signs of severe illness
Tachycardia
,
hypotension
, reduced urine output, tachypnoea, confusion, etc
Patients who are unable to tolerate oral fluids/medicines
Patients at risk of developing complications
Those with underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus
All babies under 3 months
65 years old +
Patients with a known abnormalities of the of the genitourinary tract
Hospital treatment may be required so that intravenous antibiotics can be given.
Rarely, surgery may be required to drain a renal abscess. Recurrent pyelonephritis can be caused by structural problems and surgery may be required to correct abnormalities to reduce the risk of further infections.
In very severe infection, a nephrectomy may be required.

Complications
If treated appropriately complications can often be avoided however they can occur. The main ones to be aware of include:
Early-
Acute kidney injury
Urosepsis
If the bacteria enter the bloodstream, sepsis can occur
Perinephric/renal abscess
Premature labour in pregnancy
Late-
Chronic pyelonephritis
Characterised by scarring on the kidney which occurs after recurrent or persistent infections
Can be asymptomatic
