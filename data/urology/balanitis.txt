Balanitis
Balanitis
Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis and sometimes extends to the underside of the foreskin which is known as balanoposthitis. There are a number of causes of balanitis and the most common causes are infective (both bacterial and candidal) although there are a number of other autoimmune causes that are important to know. Simple hygiene is a key part of the treatment of balanitis and both improper washing under the foreskin and the presence of a tight foreskin can make balanitis worse. The presentation can either be acute or more chronic and children and adults are affected by the causes differently.

Clinical features
Assessment:
Most diagnoses are made clinically based on the history and examination.
The history will tell you how acute the presentation is and other key features that are important to note are whether there is itching or discharge.
In the history also look for the presence of other systemic conditions affecting the skin such as eczema, psoriasis or connective tissue diseases.

Investigations
Investigations:
The majority of conditions are diagnosed clinically based on the history and physical appearance of the glans penis.
In the cases of suspected infective causes a swab can be taken for microscopy and culture which may demonstrate bacteria or
Candida albicans
.
When there is a doubt about the cause and there is extensive skin change, then a biopsy can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

Differential diagnosis
The table below shows the clinical features associated with the most common causes of balanitis, whether they occur in children or adults and how common they are:
Diagnosis
Frequency
Acute or Chronic?
Features
Children or Adults?
Candidiasis
Very common
Acute
Usually occurs after intercourse and associated with itching and white non-urethral discharge
Both
Dermatitis (contact or allergic)
Very common
Acute
Itchy, sometimes painful and occasionally associated with a clear non-urethral discharge. Often there is no other body area affected
Both
Dermatitis (eczema or psoriasis)
Very common
Both
Very itchy but not associated with any discharge and there will be a medical history of an inflammatory skin condition with active areas elsewhere on the body
Both
Bacterial
Common
Acute
Painful and can be itchy with yellow non-urethral discharge and most often due to
Staphylococcus spp.
Both
Anaerobic
Common
Acute
May be itchy but is most associated with a very offensive yellow non-urethral discharge
Both
Lichen planus
Uncommon
Both
May be itchy, the main diagnostic feature is the presence of Wickham's striae and violaceous papules
More commonly adults
Lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans)
Rare
Chronic
May be itchy, associated with white plaques and can cause significant scarring
Both
Plasma cell balanitis of Zoon
Rare
Chronic
Not itchy with clearly circumscribed areas of inflammation
Both
Circinate balanitis
Uncommon
Both
Not itchy and not associated with any discharge. The key feature is painless erosions and it can be associated with Reiter's syndrome
Adults

Management
General treatment:
There are three things which form the basis of management of all causes of balanitis; gentle saline washes, ensuring to wash properly under the foreskin, and in the case of more severe irritation and discomfort then 1% hydrocortisone can be used for a short period.
When the cause is not clear, these measures can often resolve the condition alone.
Specific treatment:
In the case of candidiasis the treatment is with topical clotrimazole which has to be applied for two weeks to fully treat the infection.
Bacterial balanitis is most often due to
Staphylococcus spp.
or Group B
Streptococcus spp.
and can be treated with oral flucloxacillin or clarithromycin if penicillin allergic.
Anaerobic balanitis is managed with saline washing and can also be managed with topical or oral metronidazole if not settling.
Dermatitis and circinate balanitis are managed with mild potency topical corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone)
Lichen sclerosus and plasma cell balanitis of Zoon are managed with high potency topical steroids (e.g. clobetasol).
Circumcision can help in the case of lichen sclerosus.
