Further investigations
Initial investigations
exclude
pregnancy
with urinary or serum bHCG
full blood count, urea & electrolytes, coeliac screen, thyroid function tests
gonadotrophins
low levels indicate a hypothalamic cause where as raised levels suggest an ovarian problem (e.g. Premature ovarian failure)
raised if gonadal dysgenesis (e.g. Turner's syndrome)
prolactin
androgen levels
raised levels may be seen in PCOS
oestradiol

Further management
Management
primary amenorrhoea:
investigate and treat any underlying cause
with primary ovarian insufficiency due to gonadal dysgenesis (e.g. Turner's syndrome) are likely to benefit from hormone replacement therapy (e.g. to prevent osteoporosis etC)
secondary amenorrhoea
exclude
pregnancy
, lactation, and menopause (in women 40 years of age or older)
