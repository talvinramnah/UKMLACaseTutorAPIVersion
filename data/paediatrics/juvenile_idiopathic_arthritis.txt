Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Juvenile
idiopathic arthritis
(JIA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects children. It is characterized by joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness that can lead to joint damage and disability if left untreated. JIA is a heterogeneous disease with several subtypes, each with its own unique clinical features and treatment options. The most common subtype is oligoarticular JIA, which affects fewer than five joints and has a good prognosis with early intervention. Other subtypes include polyarticular JIA, systemic JIA, and enthesitis-related JIA. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologic agents, and physical therapy.

Clinical features
The most common subtype of JIA is oligoarticular JIA, which presents with joint swelling and pain in four or fewer joints. The affected joints are usually large joints such as the knee, ankle, or wrist. Oligoarticular JIA may also be associated with uveitis, which can cause eye redness, pain, and vision loss.
Polyarticular JIA affects five or more joints and can be further classified into
rheumatoid factor
(RF)-positive or RF-negative subtypes. RF-positive polyarticular JIA is characterized by symmetric joint involvement, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. RF-negative polyarticular JIA typically involves larger joints such as the knee, hip, and shoulder.
Systemic JIA is a subtype of JIA that presents with
fever
,
rash
, and arthritis. The fever is typically high and spiking, and the rash is often evanescent and non-pruritic. Systemic JIA can also be associated with serositis,
lymphadenopathy
, and hepatosplenomegaly.
Enthesitis-related JIA is a subtype of JIA that primarily affects the entheses, which are the sites where tendons and ligaments attach to bone. Enthesitis-related JIA can present with joint pain and swelling, particularly in the lower extremities. It can also be associated with enthesitis, dactylitis, and uveitis.
Psoriatic JIA is a subtype of JIA that is associated with psoriasis. It can present with joint pain and swelling, particularly in the fingers and toes. Psoriatic JIA can also be associated with nail pitting, onycholysis, and dactylitis.
