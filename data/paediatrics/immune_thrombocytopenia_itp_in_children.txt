Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children
Immune
thrombocytopenia
(
ITP
) is an acquired autoimmune condition which is characterised by abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood, typically manifesting as a widespread
petechial rash
. It is a relatively rare condition which is more common in younger populations, occurring in approximately 4 in every 100,000 children per year. The prognosis of this condition in children is very good, with 80% achieving full remission with conservative management.

Pathophysiology
- The exact aetiology of
ITP
is still unknown, however most cases arise after a preceding viral illness
Antibodies directed against viral antigens during a viral illness may cross-react with normal platelet antigens (molecular mimicry)
It is thought that genetic immune dysregulation via T-cell anomalies may be responsible
The pathophysiological process is multi-factorial and complex, but is thought to be initiated by the following autoimmune processes:
Increased destruction of platelets in the spleen (by anti-platelet auto antibodies directed against platelet membrane antigens)
Inhibition of platelet production via suppression of megakaryocyte precursors, also by auto-antibodies
T-cell mediated destruction of platelets and megakaryocyte precursors in the bone marrow (possibly due to T-cell mediated cytotoxicity, and/or dysregulated mechanisms of regulatory T-cells and B-cells)
The auto-antibody production is thought to be caused by dysregulated CD4+ helper T-cells reacting to platelet surface glycoproteins (e.g. glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex)

Clinical features
The most typical presentation of
ITP
is an otherwise well child with a
petechial rash
alone. Usually there is a history of a
recent viral illness
, in approximately 60% of children. This tends to be a viral upper respiratory tract infection, however can also be gastrointestinal in nature.
Cutaneous rash
ITP most frequently manifests as the sudden appearance of a petechial rash (small, purpuric lesions up to 2mm diameter), however larger
purpura
or
bruising
can also be present
This cutaneous rash is present in approximately 86% of children with diagnosed ITP
In greater than 50% of children with ITP, a cutaneous rash is the
only
clinical symptom
Mucocutaneous bleeding
Bleeding from mucosal surfaces occurs in approximately 40% of children with ITP
The location of the bleeding can vary:
Epistaxis (20%)
Oral bleeding, for example buccal and gingival surfaces (20%)
Very infrequently, bleeding can occur from the gastrointestinal, menstrual or urinary tract (<5%)
Severe
haemorrhage
A very rare clinical symptom of ITP is severe haemorrhage (<3%)
Intracranial haemorrhage (<1%) may present with signs and symptoms such as:
Headache
Persistent vomiting
Altered mental state e.g. confusion, drowsiness
Seizures
Improve
Investigations
According to BMJ best practice,
ITP
is a diagnosis of exclusion and therefore majority of investigations are directed towards ruling out other differential diagnoses.
Full blood count
Platelets
An isolated
thrombocytopenia
with a platelet count of <100x10
9
/L is usually the
only
blood abnormality
According to UptoDate, most presenting cases have a count of <30x10
9
/L because those with a higher count tend to be asymptomatic and therefore do not get investigated
White blood cells
Should be within normal limits
If abnormal, should spark suspicion of another condition (see below)
Haemoglobin
Usually within normal limits
Anaemia is very occasionally seen, usually in children who have had significant
haemorrhage
Peripheral blood smear
Platelets will appear reduced in number
Red and white blood cells will be of normal count and morphology
In patients with severe haemorrhage, microcytic hypochromic red blood cells may be seen (reflecting an iron deficiency anaemia)
Bone marrow biopsy
BMJ recommend performing this test
only
if there is an atypical blood film
The bone marrow biopsy should appear normal in ITP, otherwise one must consider other differentials
Investigation findings prompting further evaluation
As stated prior, in ITP, there should be an isolated thrombocytopenia
UptoDate suggest that the following findings should steer away from an ITP diagnosis:
Premature white cells e.g. blasts (consider possible lymphoma or leukaemia)
Predominant giant platelets, or very small platelets (consider inherited thrombocytopaenia syndromes)
Reticulocytosis (consider haemolytic anaemia)
Schistocytosis (consider microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia)

Differential diagnosis
Henoch Schonlein
purpura
In an otherwise well child with a cutaneous rash, this is a very likely differential, given the characteristic similarities between both conditions
Similarities
Both can have petechiae
Both more common in children than adults
Both tend to have a viral prodrome
Differences
HSP tends to be characterised by palpable purpura
Arthritis/arthralgia present
Rash tends to be present in lower limbs and buttock area
Haematological malignancy
For example, leukaemia and lymphoma
Both
ITP
and leukaemia have a similar incidence in the UK, with rates of 4 cases per 100,000, therefore this is a more common differential than one night predict
It is an important one to exclude and therefore it is imperative to check for red flags in a child with symptoms of bleeding
Similarities
Both can present with symptoms of bleeding e.g. petechiae,
bruising
, mucosal bleeding
Differences
In malignancy, patients may have concurrent signs of concern including enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, bone pain, joint pain and/or unexpected weight loss
Bloods may show abnormalities such as neutropenia, atypical or immature cells, marked anaemia and/or leukocytosis
Meningococcal disease
In an otherwise well child, this is an unlikely differential diagnosis
However, if a child is concurrently unwell, this should be a differential diagnosis high on the list given its high incidence in children (31 per 100,000 in children aged 0-4, and 5 per 100,000 in children aged 5-9)
Similarities
Both can present with
petechial rash
More common in children
Differences
Children will be unwell (e.g. irritability, lethargy)
Usually will have abnormal vital signs (e.g. tachycardia, tachypnoea, widened pulse pressure, febrile)
Bloods may show raised white cell count and CRP
Congenital thrombocytopenic syndromes
Similarities
Both present with
thrombocytopenia
and/or mucocutaneous bleeding
Differences
Positive family history of congenital thrombocytopenic syndromes
Predominantly large (giant) or small platelets on blood film
May see Dohle body-like inclusions on blood smear
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
Similarities
Present with mucocutaneous bleeding
Petechiae usually present
Differences
Usually patients are very unwell
Can present with sepsis (e.g. hypotension, tachypnoea, fever)
Bloods may show elevated prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and D-dimer

Management
The management of
ITP
is different in children compared to adults. This topic focuses only on the treatment of children.
Initial platelet count
The initial platelet count is not a
sole
determinator of what form of management is initially required
Normally, the platelet count together with the clinical picture (particularly the symptoms of bleeding) are used as a guide for the management approach
According to the BMJ best practice guidelines, a platelet count of <20-30,000/microL is a threshold for active treatment, as this is the count where the risk of active bleeding increases
An initial platelet count of <10,000/microL is considered severe and in these situations it is more likely that active management will be undertaken regardless of the symptom profile
Conservative management
ITP in children will resolve spontaneously within 3 weeks in 30-70% of children, according to BMJ
In children who are asymptomatic (e.g. ITP noted incidentally on blood tests), or with minor bleeding symptoms (e.g. cutaneous manifestations), observation without active management is appropriate
Active management
This is restricted to children with major bleeding symptoms (e.g. ongoing epistaxis, mucosal bleeding) or a severely low platelet count
In general, if treatment is required, a platelet target of â‰¥20,000 to 30,000/microL is used (the platelet count threshold above which the risk of serious bleeding is reduced)
Corticosteroids
According to BMJ best practice, this is the usual first-line treatment
Prednisolone 1-2mg/kg/day orally, with tapering as soon as symptoms begin to clear
IVIg and anti-D immunoglobulin
Reserved for if corticosteroids are contraindicated or ineffective
In those who are resistant to the above treatment, or in those with chronic ITP, medications such as mycophenolate, rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonists can be considered (with specialist input)
Severe life-threatening bleeding
In those with severe
haemorrhage
, aggressive treatment is required
According to BMJ best practice, the first line management is with IVIg, corticosteroids, plus platelet transfusions
IVIg 1g/kg intravenously as a single dose
Prednisolone 1-2mg/kg/day orally
Alternatively, UptoDate suggest methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg per day (up to 1 g) intravenously for 3-4 days
Platelet transfusions
UptoDate recommend platelet transfusions of a bolus dose of 10-30 mL/kg, then followed by a continuous infusion
The role of these platelet transfusions is to ensure that the child maintains a haemostatic platelet count and to guide further treatment
Therefore, platelet transfusions are
not
curative in nature, as the platelets will continue to be destroyed at a more rapid rate due to the auto-immune processes in ITP
If severe haemorrhage results in hypovolaemia, fluid resuscitation is also indicated, however this is extremely rare
Monitoring
All
patients with ITP, regardless of whether a conservative or active management approach is taken, should have their platelet count monitored regularly
Typically, UptoDate recommend monitoring platelet count weekly in the initial stages, with the interval between tests increasing as the clinical picture of the patient stabilises
Normally, monitoring will continue until the platelet count is within normal limits (>150,000/microL) and is stable without any active management
Improve
Complications
Severe bleeding
The risk of severe bleeding as a result of
ITP
in children is approximately 3%, therefore is relatively rare
Severe bleeding is defined by UptoDate as epistaxis which lasts >5-15 minutes in duration, gastrointestinal bleeding, other severe mucosal bleeding requiring hospital admission and/or blood transfusions
Those at higher risk of severe bleeding include:
Those with platelet count <10,000/microL
Traumatic event, e.g. head injury, falls
Concurrent use of blood thinning medications e.g. aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, heparin (rare in children)
Intracranial
haemorrhage
This is the most severe and life threatening complication of ITP
The risk is extremely low, less than 0.5%
The risk factors for developing intracranial haemorrhage are the same as the risk for severe bleeding (as above)
Children with ITP and symptoms of possible ICH (e.g. headache, vomiting, seizures, confusion) should have neuroimaging completed in a timely manner, particularly if the platelet count is <10,000 to 20,000/microL (according to UptoDate)
Chronic ITP
Chronic ITP can be considered a complication of ITP, as the majority of cases resolve spontaneously
Chronic ITP is defined as ITP which persists for >12 months since presentation
Improve
Prognosis
- The prognosis of
ITP
in children is very good, with over 70% of children recovering spontaneously within 3 weeks
The best prognosis is for children less than 10 years old, who tend to be more likely to recover completely compared to older patients
Only 2.5-5% of patients will be refractory to
all
treatments available
Even after many years of having chronic ITP, spontaneous remission still occurs in over 50% of children
The mortality is very low, with deaths usually being a result of catastrophic severe bleeding with complications
