Infantile colic
Infantile colic
Infantile colic is characterised by paroxysms of persistent and uncontrollable crying in an otherwise healthy infant. It is extremely common, affecting approximately 15-20% of infants, being much more frequent in the first 6-weeks of life. It is a self-limiting and benign condition, usually resolving by 5 months of age, although is associated with significant caregiver anxiety and frustration due to the nature of the condition.

Aetiology
Unfortunately, the aetiology of infantile colic is not entirely understood. Although the aetiology is likely multi-factorial in nature, a number of mechanisms have been proposed, including gastrointestinal, psychosocial, and biological aetiologies.
Gastrointestinal aetiologies
Infantile colic is frequently thought to be due to a disturbance in the gastrointestinal system, for example the Rome IV criteria classifies infantile colic as a functional gastrointestinal disorder in infants
In fact, the origin of the word 'colic' itself implies a gastrointestinal origin
Proposed mechanisms leading to infantile colic include:
Differences in gut microbiome, particularly alterations in
Klebsiella
species, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria,
Escherichia coli
and
Lactobacillus
species
Increased intra-luminal gas due to unabsorbed carbohydrate fermentation by colonic bacteria
Increased number of gastrointestinal and systemic inflammatory markers
Gastrointestinal dysmotility: notably intestinal hypermotility secondary to autonomic imbalance
Visceral hypersensitivity: increase in pain signals from hypersensitive gut visceral pathways
Faulty feeding techniques which lead to under/over feeding, or infrequent burping and inadequate gas expulsion leading to abdominal distention and intestinal spasm may lead to infantile colic
Psychosocial aetiologies
There is an association between certain psychosocial factors in the parents and infantile colic, including:
Stressful pregnancies and birth
Post-partum depression
Parental anxiety and depression, even paternal depression during pregnancy
Lower parental education and intelligence
It has been proposed that infantile colic is actually a psychosocial phenomenon, whereby it is the caregiver's perception of excessive and uncontrollable crying which defines whether it is considered 'normal crying' or infantile colic
Biological aetiologies
One of the theories that has been studied is that infantile colic may be the early manifestation of migraine, although studies have shown inconclusive results regarding this association
Tobacco smoke and nicotine exposure, particularly during pregnancy or the post-partum period, is associated with a greater risk of developing infantile colic (twice as common)
Elevated serotonin levels may play a role in infantile colic, where some studies have shown that urinary 5-OH IAA concentrations are greater in infants with colic compared to controls

Clinical features
Infantile colic is characteristically described as paroxysms of uncontrollable crying in an infant less than three months old. Paroxysms of crying indicate that these episodes tend to have a clear beginning and end, as in they seem to begin and end suddenly with no clear reason why. These episodes tend to occur early in the morning and in the evening within clusters. A key feature in infantile colic is that the infant is
unable to be consoled
, for example it is not possible to stop the crying by soothing, feeding or burping the infant.
The cry in colic tends to be more severe than that of normal crying, for example the cry may be:
Louder
Higher in frequency
Described as 'screaming' rather than crying
More piercing/grating in nature
Other clinical features which may occur during the episodes of colic include:
Facial flushing
Tense abdomen
Drawing up of legs to the abdomen
Clenched fists
Circumoral pallor
Stiffening and tightening of arms
Back arching
There is difficulty in distinguishing what is considered 'normal crying' to infantile colic. A useful tool, the Wessell criteria, defines infantile colic as:
Unexplained crying or fussiness
In an otherwise healthy infant
All red flags and organic causes of crying ruled out (see below in differential diagnosis)
Resolves by 3 months of age
Lasts for greater than 3 hours per day
Occurs on greater than 3 days per week
Persists for greater than 3 weeks
Another important factor in infantile colic is the
absence
of red flag symptoms and signs. Infantile colic is generally a diagnosis of exclusion, as it occurs in an
otherwise healthy
infant. Usually an organic cause of crying is only found in approximately 10% of patients who present with excessive crying. Red flag features which must be absent include:
Fever
Evidence of diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal distention
Reduced conscious state e.g. lethargy, drowsiness, floppy
Signs of trauma e.g. bruising, bleeding, fractures
Poor feeding
Poor weight gain and growth
Signs of developmental delay
Improve
Differential diagnosis
It is important to remember that infantile colic is a diagnosis of exclusion, and signs of more serious disease or organic causes of crying must be ruled out first.
Normal crying
For many new parents, it may be difficult to cope with a crying child. It is possible that a new parent may be unable to identify what is considered 'normal crying' compared to infantile colic
Similarities
On average, infants normally cry for over 2-3 hours per day (cumulative)
May be present in discrete episodes
In both, it tends to increase in the earliest weeks of life, and peak around 6 weeks of age. It tends to improve by 3-4 months of age
Differences
Normal crying is usually consolable by soothing, feeding, burping, or changing nappies (there is usually a discernible cause of crying)
The crying in infantile colic tends to be louder, more 'screaming' in nature, of a higher pitch
Intussusception
Similarities
Both tend to present with colicky episodes of irritability
Both may draw legs up to the abdomen during episodes
Infants may appear very well or normal in between episodes
Differences
Vomiting may be present
Infants with intussusception may have diarrhoea, 'red-currant jelly' like stools or rectal bleeding
The pathognomonic sign is an elongated mass in the right upper quadrant
Cow's milk protein allergy
Similarities
Infants will be irritable
Colicky episodes may be present in both
Differences
Usually will have other symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea with blood/mucous, eczema
May have poor weight gain and growth
May have family history of milk protein allergy also
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
Similarities
Colicky episodes of irritability present
May be otherwise entirely well between episodes
Differences
May present with recurrent regurgitation of feeds after meals, often effortless and is worse when the infant lying down
May have poor weight gain and growth
In severe cases, may have haematemesis
Lactose overload/intolerance
Similarities
Significant crying, may be in distinct episodes
Irritable child
Differences
May have watery, frothy, and/or explosive diarrhoea
May have poor growth and weight gain
Anal excoriations and/or ulcerations may be present
Urinary tract infection
Similarities
Infants may both be more irritable
Acute onset of crying
Differences
UTI more common in females than males
Presence of malodorous urine
Fever may be present

Management
As infantile colic is a self-limiting and benign condition, it will usually self resolve by 3-5 months of age. Therefore, thorough education to the caregivers is absolutely key to allay anxiety and parental concern, as well as address any false beliefs regarding the condition.
Caregiver education and support
According to both BMJ best practice and UptoDate, the first-line technique to manage infantile colic is parental education and support, as the condition can result in significant distress and anxiety for the caregivers
It is important to educate the caregiver on the benign and self-limiting nature of the condition, providing reassurance that the infant is not unwell and that it will spontaneously resolve by 3-5 months of age
It is also essential to remind the parent that it is not their fault and that it is not something they are causing, to prevent feelings of guilt and failure which can further negatively impact the parent-infant relationship
Appropriate feeding techniques
Appropriate feeding techniques may be useful to address some of the potential causes of infantile colic, although the evidence is limited to prove a definite benefit (given the unclear aetiology of the condition)
The theory is that feeding techniques may be useful to assist in infant soothing, as well as reduce swallowed air which can cause pain
Proper feeding techniques include:
If bottle-feeding, do so in a vertical position to reduce swallowed air
Frequent burping post-feed to release trapped air
Consider consultation with a lactation specialist
Curved bottles, or bottles with a collapsible air bag may be useful to reduce air consumption
Dietary changes
Dietary changes should only be considered if first-line techniques fail, or if cow protein milk allergy is strongly suspected
If there is a strong suspicion for cows protein milk allergy, this should be eliminated from the infants diet
BMJ best practice suggest a trial of also eliminating cows milk from the mothers diet, if breastfeeding
BMJ best practice and UptoDate recommend a trial of a hypo-allergenic extensive hydrolysate infant formula (if formula-feeding) after failure to respond to other interventions
If there is a response, usually within 48 hours, this should be continued
