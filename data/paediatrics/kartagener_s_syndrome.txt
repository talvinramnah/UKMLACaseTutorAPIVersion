Kartagener's syndrome
Kartagener's syndrome (also known as primary ciliary dyskinesia) was first described in 1933. It is characterised by dextrocardia and bronchiectasis.

Management
Management of Kartagener's syndrome involves a multidisciplinary approach, with key steps including:
Chest physiotherapy:
Regular chest physiotherapy is essential to promote clearance of bronchial secretions. Techniques such as postural drainage and percussive techniques may be beneficial.
Bronchodilators:
These medications can help to widen the airways and make it easier for patients to breathe. Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) or long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) can be used depending on the severity of symptoms.
Antibiotics:
Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered in patients with frequent exacerbations. When infections do occur, they should be treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics targeting potential organisms such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and
H. influenzae
.
Mucolytic agents:
Medications like N-acetylcysteine can help to thin mucus in the lungs, making it easier for patients to cough up.
Sinus management:
Regular nasal irrigation with saline solution can help manage sinus symptoms. Topical corticosteroids may also be beneficial.
Surgical interventions:
In severe cases where medical management has failed, surgical interventions such as lobectomy or bronchiectasis may be considered. Sinus surgery might also be needed for chronic sinusitis unresponsive to medical treatment.
In addition to these specific measures, regular vaccinations against respiratory pathogens including influenza and pneumococcus are recommended. Nutritional support may also be required due to increased energy demands from chronic lung disease.
