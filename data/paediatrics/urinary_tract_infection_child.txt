Urinary tract infection (child)
Urinary tract infection
(UTI) is a common bacterial infection in children, especially in girls. The diagnosis of UTI in children can be challenging as the symptoms may be non-specific or absent. Therefore, it is important to have a high index of suspicion in children with unexplained
fever
,
abdominal pain
,
vomiting
, or poor feeding. A urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, and a positive result indicates the presence of significant bacteriuria.

Management
Management
infants less than 3 months old should be referred immediately to a paediatrician
children aged more than 3 months old with an upper UTI should be considered for admission to hospital. If not admitted oral antibiotics such as cephalosporin or co-amoxiclav should be given for 7-10 days
children aged more than 3 months old with a lower UTI should be treated with oral antibiotics for 3 days according to local guidelines, usually trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporin or amoxicillin. Parents should be asked to bring the children back if they remain unwell after 24-48 hours
antibiotic prophylaxis is not given after the first UTI but should be considered with recurrent UTIs
