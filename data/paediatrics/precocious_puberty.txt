Precocious puberty
Precocious puberty
Precocious puberty
is characterised by the onset of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls and 9 in boys. It's categorised into two types:
central precocious puberty (CPP)
, resulting from premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and
peripheral precocious puberty (PPP)
, due to excessive sex steroids independent of gonadotropin secretion. Aetiologies encompass idiopathic causes, central nervous system abnormalities, endocrine disorders and genetic mutations.
Clinical manifestations vary between genders but may include rapid growth, advanced bone age, acne and behavioural changes. Diagnosis involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, laboratory investigations for hormonal levels and imaging studies.
Management focuses on halting pubertal progression and minimising psychosocial implications. GnRH analogues are first-line treatment for CPP while PPP requires targeted therapy depending on underlying cause.
