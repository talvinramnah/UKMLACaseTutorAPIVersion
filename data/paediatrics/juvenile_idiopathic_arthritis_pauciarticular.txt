Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: pauciarticular
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: pauciarticular
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects children. Pauciarticular JIA is the most common subtype, accounting for approximately 50% of all cases. It is characterized by inflammation in four or fewer joints, typically affecting the knees, ankles, and wrists. Girls are more commonly affected than boys, and the onset of symptoms usually occurs between the ages of 2 and 4 years.
The diagnosis of pauciarticular JIA is based on clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologic agents. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may also be used to manage joint inflammation.
Complications of pauciarticular JIA include uveitis, growth retardation, and joint damage. Regular monitoring of disease activity and prompt treatment of complications is essential to prevent long-term disability.

Clinical features
Pauciarticular JIA involves four or fewer joints, most commonly affecting the knees, ankles, and wrists.
The affected joints are often swollen, warm, and tender to touch.
Children with pauciarticular JIA may experience morning stiffness, which improves with activity throughout the day.
In some cases, pauciarticular JIA can cause uveitis. This can lead to eye pain, redness, and sensitivity to light.
Children with pauciarticular JIA may also experience growth abnormalities, such as one leg being shorter than the other or a difference in arm length.
Some children with pauciarticular JIA may have a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test

Management
Management of Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA): pauciarticular involves a multi-disciplinary approach to optimise patient outcomes. The following are key steps in the management protocol:
Pharmacological Management:
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often first-line treatment for symptomatic relief. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, may be introduced for persistent or severe disease. Biological agents like tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors may be considered if DMARDs are ineffective.
Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injections:
These can provide rapid relief from joint inflammation and pain. Hyaluronic acid injections may also be considered in certain cases.
Surgical Intervention:
In severe cases where medical management fails or joint damage is extensive, surgical interventions such as synovectomy or joint replacement may be warranted
