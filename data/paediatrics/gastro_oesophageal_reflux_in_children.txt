Gastro-oesophageal reflux in children
Gastro-oesophageal reflux in children
Gastro-oesophageal reflux is the commonest cause of
vomiting
in infancy. Around 40% of infants regurgitate their feeds to a certain extent so there is a degree of overlap with normal physiological processes.

Clinical features
Typical Presentation
Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in children typically presents with regurgitation or "posseting" of feeds, particularly in infants under 12 months of age
The classic presentation is effortless regurgitation of small amounts of milk shortly after feeds, without signs of distress or discomfort
Parents often describe the infant as a "happy spitter" - regurgitating frequently but otherwise thriving and content
Symptoms usually peak at 4-6 months of age and resolve spontaneously in 90% of infants by 12 months
Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)
GORD should be suspected when reflux is accompanied by
troublesome symptoms that affect daily functioning
or complications
Key features suggesting GORD rather than physiological reflux include:
Marked distress and irritability, particularly during or after feeds
Back arching or neck hyperextension during feeds (Sandifer syndrome)
Persistent feeding difficulties including food refusal or gagging
Frequent episodes of regurgitation (>5 times/day)
Haematemesis (though rare)
Faltering growth or weight loss
Age-Specific Presentations
Infants
(0-12 months):
Primarily present with regurgitation, irritability, and feeding difficulties
May demonstrate excessive crying, particularly during and after feeds
Sleep disturbances are common
Toddlers and preschool children
(1-5 years):
May report abdominal pain or heartburn (though verbal description is limited)
Food refusal or picky eating behaviour
Chronic
cough
, particularly at night
Hoarseness or voice changes
School-age children
(>5 years):
Can typically describe heartburn or epigastric pain
May report regurgitation of sour or bitter taste
Dysphagia or odynophagia in more severe cases
Chronic cough, asthma exacerbations, or recurrent pneumonia in cases with respiratory manifestations
NICE guidance (2015)
emphasises that healthcare professionals should recognise that parents and carers may use different terminology to describe reflux symptoms, such as "posseting," "bringing up," or "spitting up"

Management
Management (partly based on the 2015 NICE guidelines)
advise regarding position during feeds - 30 degree head-up
infants should sleep on their backs as per standard guidance to reduce the risk of cot death
ensure infant is not being overfed (as per their weight) and consider a trial of smaller and more frequent feeds
a trial of thickened formula (for example, containing rice starch, cornstarch, locust bean gum or carob bean gum)
a trial of alginate therapy e.g. Gaviscon. Alginates should not be used at the same time as thickening agents
NICE do not recommend a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA), to treat overt regurgitation in infants and children occurring as an isolated symptom. A trial of one of these agents should be considered if 1 or more of the following apply:
unexplained feeding difficulties (for example, refusing feeds, gagging or choking)
distressed behaviour
faltering growth
prokinetic agents e.g. metoclopramide should only be used with specialist advice

Complications
Overview of Complications
Most infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) experience mild symptoms and do not develop significant complications. However, a minority may develop more severe sequelae, particularly if reflux is persistent or associated with underlying risk factors such as neurological impairment or prematurity.
The most important complications are those related to oesophageal injury, respiratory involvement, and nutritional compromise.
Oesophageal Complications
Oesophagitis: Chronic acid exposure can lead to inflammation of the oesophageal mucosa, manifesting as irritability, feeding aversion, pain on swallowing (odynophagia), or haematemesis.
Stricture formation: Severe or prolonged oesophagitis may rarely result in fibrotic narrowing of the oesophagus, presenting with progressive dysphagia.
Barrettâ€™s oesophagus: Although rare in children, metaplastic changes can occur after longstanding GOR; this increases the theoretical risk of adenocarcinoma in later life.
Extra-oesophageal Complications
Respiratory complications:
Recurrent aspiration may cause chronic
cough
, wheeze, stridor or pneumonia. There is also an association with exacerbation of asthma-like symptoms.
Apnoeic episodes have been reported in infants but are uncommon; a causal relationship remains debated (
NICE CG 184
).
Otolaryngological manifestations:
Chronic otitis media with effusion and laryngitis may be linked to recurrent refluxate exposure.
Nutritional and Growth Impairment
Faltering growth (failure to thrive) may occur due to inadequate caloric intake secondary to
vomiting
/regurgitation, feeding aversion or increased energy expenditure from respiratory complications.
Iron deficiency anaemia can occasionally develop due to chronic blood loss from erosive oesophagitis.
Clinicians should maintain vigilance for these complications in children with persistent symptoms or recognised risk factors.
