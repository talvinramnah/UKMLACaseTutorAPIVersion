Neonatal death or cot death
Neonatal death
, also known as
cot death
or
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)
, is an unanticipated fatality that occurs during sleep in seemingly healthy infants under one year of age. The aetiology remains largely unknown, however, it is hypothesised that SIDS may be associated with abnormalities in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep.
Several risk factors have been identified including prone sleeping position, overheating, exposure to tobacco smoke, late or no antenatal care, young maternal age and premature birth. It's important to note the 'Back to Sleep' campaign which highlights the significant reduction in SIDS when infants are placed on their backs rather than their stomachs for sleep.
Despite extensive research, prevention strategies remain limited to risk factor modification. Continued investigation into potential genetic and environmental triggers is essential for future preventive measures and understanding of this devastating condition.
