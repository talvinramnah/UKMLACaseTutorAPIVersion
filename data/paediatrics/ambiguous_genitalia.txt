Ambiguous genitalia
Ambiguous genitalia
is a rare condition characterised by atypical appearance of external genitalia that prevents immediate gender identification at birth. It primarily results from disorders of sex development (DSDs) which encompass various congenital conditions involving chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex discrepancies. Typical causes include congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5-alpha reductase deficiency, and certain forms of gonadal dysgenesis. The complexity of the disorder necessitates multidisciplinary management including endocrinology, genetics, psychology, and surgery to ensure comprehensive care. Diagnostic modalities involve physical examination, hormonal assays, imaging studies and genetic testing to ascertain the underlying aetiology. Management strategies are individualised based on factors such as underlying diagnosis, potential for fertility preservation and patient or family preferences.
