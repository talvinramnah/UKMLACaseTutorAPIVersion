Vulvovaginitis
Vulvovaginitis
Vulvovaginitis
is a common gynaecological condition characterised by inflammation of the vulva and vagina. It may be caused by various factors, including bacterial, viral, or yeast infections, chemical irritants, or hormonal changes.
Candida albicans
and
Gardnerella vaginalis
are often implicated in infectious cases.
Symptoms typically include pruritus, dysuria, abnormal discharge, and vulvar erythema. Clinically, it is important to differentiate vulvovaginitis from other conditions with similar symptomatology such as dermatitis or lichen sclerosus. Diagnosis typically involves physical examination and laboratory testing of vaginal secretions for microscopy, culture and sensitivity.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause but often involves antimicrobial therapy for infectious causes or topical steroids for inflammatory conditions. Patient education about hygiene practices can also help prevent recurrent episodes.
