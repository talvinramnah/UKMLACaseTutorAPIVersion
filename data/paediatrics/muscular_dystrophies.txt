Muscular dystrophies
Muscular dystrophies
Muscular dystrophies represent a group of genetic disorders characterised by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. The most prevalent form,
Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(DMD), primarily affects boys, leading to severe disability and premature death. DMD results from mutations in the dystrophin gene, disrupting the structural integrity of muscle fibres. Other forms include
Becker muscular dystrophy
, similar to DMD but with a later onset and slower progression;
myotonic dystrophy
, notable for its myotonia and multi-systemic features; and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, which are typified by proximal muscle weakness.
In terms of management, corticosteroids serve as the mainstay therapy for DMD, enhancing muscle strength and function. Physical therapy is also integral to maintain mobility and prevent contractures. Advanced stages may necessitate respiratory support or cardiac management due to associated complications.
