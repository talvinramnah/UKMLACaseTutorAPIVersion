Calcaneal apophysitis
Calcaneal apophysitis
Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever's disease) is the commonest cause of
heel pain
in children and adolescents. It is an overuse injury caused by micro-fractures of the calcaneal apophysis at the site of attachment of the Achilles tendon.
It typically presents between 8-14 years. It is rare after this age as the calcaneal apophysis should fuse around 15 years. It is commoner in more active children, especially in weight-bearing sports e.g. running, dancing.

Clinical features
It presents with gradual onset
heel pain
which may be worse on standing and with activity. It is typically relieved by rest. It can be unilateral but is often bilateral (60% of cases) . Medial and lateral compression of the heel i.e 'squeezing' causes pain.
Patients may also have:
Pain on ankle dorsiflexion, especially on active toe raise
Mild heel swelling
Calcaneal enlargement
Only if chronic which is rare

Investigations
It is usually a clinical diagnosis.
Investigations are largely used to exclude alternative diagnoses. These include:
X-ray to exclude fractures or tumour
X-rays findings may be normal or non-specific sclerosis.
CT/MRI can be used to exclude osteomyelitis.
Red flag features suggestive of an alternative diagnosis include significant rest pain, night pain or large swelling.

Management
Treatment is largely conservative
Avoid sports for 2 months
Can consider continuing non-weight bearing activities
Physiotherapy including stretching exercises
Footwear advice
Heel pads
Consider NSAIDs in severe cases
Rarely needs an orthopaedic referral
