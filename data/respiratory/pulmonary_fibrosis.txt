Pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterised by the scarring and thickening of lung tissue, leading to dyspnoea and decreased oxygen saturation. The aetiology can be idiopathic or secondary to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or exposure to environmental toxins. Histologically, it is marked by usual interstitial pneumonia pattern with honeycombing changes.
Diagnosis requires high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demonstrating reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing. Lung biopsy may be necessary in certain cases. Pulmonary function tests typically reveal restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO).
Management involves slowing disease progression and symptom control. Pharmacological options include antifibrotic agents like pirfenidone and nintedanib. Supportive care encompasses pulmonary rehabilitation, supplemental oxygen therapy for hypoxic patients, and palliative care in advanced stages.
