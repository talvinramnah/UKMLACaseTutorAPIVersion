Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is a diffuse interstitial lung disease that affects the distal bronchioles,
respiratory
bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveolar walls. It affects around 2 people per 100,000. The aetiology is unknown.

Clinical features
Males and females are equally affected and tend to present in the 5th or 6th decade of life and is not associated with smoking. Patients typically present with a cough,
shortness of breath
,
fever
and
malaise
. Symptoms can be present for weeks or months. There is often a history of non-response to antibiotics. Haemoptysis is rare. Clinical examination is often normal but inspiratory crackles can be heard. Wheeze and clubbing are rare.

Investigations
Bloods show a leukocytosis and an elevated ESR and CRP. Imaging typically shows bilateral patchy or diffuse consolidative or ground glass opacities. Lung function tests are most commonly restrictive but can be obstructive or normal. The transfer factor is reduced.

Management
Aims and General Approach
The primary aim of management in cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) is to achieve resolution of pulmonary inflammation, restore lung function, and prevent relapse.
Treatment should be individualised based on the severity of symptoms, extent of radiological involvement, and presence of
respiratory
compromise.
Early recognition and initiation of therapy are essential to improve outcomes.
Pharmacological Management
Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for COP.
Initial therapy is typically commenced with oral corticosteroids. Most patients demonstrate a rapid clinical and radiological response within days to weeks.
Duration of corticosteroid therapy is usually several months, with gradual tapering over 6â€“12 months depending on clinical response and risk of relapse. Close monitoring for steroid-related adverse effects is advised.
According to current UK practice (
NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries
), corticosteroids remain first-line; there is no strong evidence supporting alternative initial therapies.
In cases where patients are intolerant of corticosteroids or have frequent relapses:
Immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil may be considered as steroid-sparing alternatives under specialist advice.
Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin) have been used in select cases with mild disease or steroid contraindications, though robust evidence remains limited.
Specialist Referral and Additional Considerations
All patients with suspected or confirmed COP should be managed in conjunction with a respiratory physician.
Hospital admission may be required for severe hypoxaemia or rapidly progressive disease.
Relapse occurs in up to one third of patients during steroid tapering or after discontinuation. Long-term follow-up with serial imaging and lung function testing is recommended to detect recurrence early.
In rare refractory cases, further evaluation for alternative diagnoses or underlying causes should be undertaken. Lung biopsy may be necessary if diagnosis remains uncertain despite standard investigations.
The majority of patients experience complete recovery following appropriate immunosuppressive therapy.
