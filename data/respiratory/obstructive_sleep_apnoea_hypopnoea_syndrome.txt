Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome
Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome
Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to intermittent hypoxia and arousals from sleep. The prevalence of OSAHS is increasing due to the rising prevalence of obesity and ageing population. Patients with OSAHS often present with
excessive daytime sleepiness
,
snoring
, witnessed apnoeas, and morning headaches. OSAHS is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and metabolic disorders.
The diagnosis of OSAHS is based on clinical history, physical examination, and polysomnography. Treatment options include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, weight loss, and surgery. CPAP is the most effective treatment for OSAHS and has been shown to improve symptoms, quality of life, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Aetiology
There are several predisposing factors to the development of OSAHS:
Obesity:
This is the most significant risk factor for OSAHS. Excessive adipose tissue in the neck and thorax can increase the mechanical load on the
respiratory
system, contributing to upper airway collapse during sleep.
Age:
The risk of OSAHS increases with age, likely due to age-related changes in upper airway muscle function and structure, as well as increased fat distribution around the neck.
Male Sex:
OSAHS is more common in men, possibly due to differences in fat distribution, hormonal influences, and anatomical variations in the airway.
Menopause:
Post-menopausal women have a higher risk of OSAHS, suggesting a protective role of oestrogen and progesterone in maintaining upper airway patency.
Family History:
There is a genetic predisposition to OSAHS, suggesting that inherited factors contribute to the disease.
Anatomical Factors:
Conditions that reduce the size of the upper airway, such as adenotonsillar hypertrophy, retrognathia, or craniofacial abnormalities, can predispose to OSAHS.
Alcohol and Sedatives:
These substances can reduce the tone of the upper airway muscles, promoting airway collapse during sleep.
Smoking:
It may increase the risk of OSAHS by causing inflammation and fluid retention in the upper airway.
Medical Conditions:
Conditions like hypothyroidism, acromegaly, and polycystic ovary syndrome can increase the risk of OSAHS.

Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of OSAHS involves recurring episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, resulting from a balance between forces promoting airway patency and those promoting airway collapse.
Forces Promoting Airway Patency:
These include the activity of the upper airway dilator muscles and lung volume. During wakefulness, neural input to the dilator muscles (such as the genioglossus) counterbalances the negative intraluminal pressure generated during inspiration, keeping the airway open.
Forces Promoting Airway Collapse:
These include the negative intraluminal pressure generated during inspiration, the weight of the neck and pharyngeal soft tissues, and the loss of muscle tone during sleep.
In OSAHS, when a person transitions from wakefulness to sleep, the reduced muscle tone coupled with the negative pressure generated by inspiration leads to airway collapse. This causes a reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of airflow despite ongoing
respiratory
efforts. These events trigger brief arousals (micro-awakenings) to restore airway patency, resulting in fragmented sleep.
This repetitive cycle of hypoxia, reoxygenation, and sleep fragmentation leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation, which can contribute to the long-term complications of OSAHS such as
hypertension
, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders.

and may report periods of apnoea.
Consequence

Formal assessment of
sleepiness
Epworth Sleepiness Scale - questionnaire completed by patient +/- partner
Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) - measures the time to fall asleep in a dark room (using EEG criteria)
Improve
Diagnosis
- sleep studies (polysomnography) - ranging from monitoring of pulse oximetry at night to full polysomnography where a wide variety of physiological factors are measured including EEG,
respiratory
airflow, thoraco-abdominal movement,
snoring
and pulse oximetry

Management
Management
weight loss
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is first line for moderate or severe OSAHS
intra-oral devices (e.g. mandibular advancement) may be used if CPAP is not tolerated or for patients with mild OSAHS where there is no daytime sleepiness
the DVLA should be informed if OSAHS is causing
excessive daytime sleepiness
limited evidence to support use of pharmacological agents
