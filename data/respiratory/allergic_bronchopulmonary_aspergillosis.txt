Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
Colonisation of the
respiratory
tract with
Aspergillus fumigatus
can cause spectra of fungal infection in the lower respiratory infection which includes; chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (aspergilloma or fungal ball), chronic cavitary or necrotizing aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and invasive aspergillosis. Hypersensitivity respiratory disorders caused by
Aspergillus
species other than ABPA are allergic sinusitis, IgE-mediated asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in response to colonisation of the respiratory tract with
Aspergillus fumigatus
.  When an individual with normal immune systems is exposed to Aspergillus, a reaction to it is rare. It predominantly affects patients with a pre-existing medical condition like atopy, asthma, or cystic fibrosis (CF). Usually, the patient presents with features of airway obstruction, inflammation, and mucoid impaction that lead to
bronchiectasis
, fibrosis, and respiratory compromise in chronic cases.

Aetiology
It is a hypersensitivity reaction to
Aspergillus fumigatus
(most common) fungal spores.
Aspergillus
spores are ubiquitous in the environment and their presence on culture does not necessarily implicate them in disease.
Likely risk factors
Asthma
ABPA prevalence varies from 2-32%. The thick mucus in the airways of these patients makes it difficult to clear up the
Aspergillus
spores when inhaled.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) especially patients with preexisting atopy
ABPA in patients with CF is 2-15%. Impaired mucus clearance and airway inflammation predisposes to develop ABPA
Personal history of atopy:
Aspergillus fumigatus
that enters or colonises the bronchial passages acts as an allergen, inducing activated lymphocytes (Th2 cells) to stimulate the production of eosinophils.
Possible risk factors
Genetic factors may predispose to susceptibility and influence pathogenesis, including variations in
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations
HLA-DR2 and/or DR5 in absence of HLA-DQ2 sequences
Interleukin (IL)-10 promoter polymorphisms
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation
Surfactant protein polymorphisms - associated with increased total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophilia
Associated conditions
Atopic conditions like
Atopic dermatitis
Allergic rhinitis
Asthma
Food allergies
Pre-existing pulmonary disease like
bronchiectasis
Immunocompromised condition: rarely ABPA can occur in Hyper IgE syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, and in lung transplant recipients.

Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of ABPA is still not fully understood. The
Aspergillus
allergens induce IgE-mediated (type I ) and IgG-mediated (type III) reactions.
Healthy individuals easily eliminate
Aspergillus
conidia from the
respiratory
tract by the innate immune system mechanisms; therefore, there are no signs of pulmonary fungal infections. If secluded in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), then it only reflects colonisation, not an infection.
In patients with history of asthma, cystic fibrosis, and cavitary lung diseases, inhalation of
Aspergillus fumigatus
spores triggers a type I hypersensitivity response that causes symptoms like cough with expectoration and breathlessness. The pathophysiology is explained below.
Aspergillus fumigatus
act as an allergen
T lymphocytes are recruited (mainly Th2)
Th2 CD4+ T cells secrete cytokines which promote IgE and IgG synthesis and enhance eosinophil production and survival
Mast cells are activated and eosinophils are recruited, causing mediator release and subsequent vasodilation and bronchoconstriction
Local inflammation results in mucus production, airway hyperreactivity, and
bronchiectasis
Further mucociliary and airway clearance compromise may occur due to epithelial cell barrier damage secondary to
Aspergillus
proteolytic products.
Improve
Clinical features
ABPA occurs primarily in patients with asthma (2-32% prevalence) or cystic fibrosis (2-15% prevalence). It occurs in patients during their teens or early adulthood. The presentation is variable and may range from mild
respiratory
symptoms to severe symptoms like a respiratory failure. Most commonly ABPA present as worsening of asthma or cystic fibrosis symptoms. Patients often present as
New or worsening cough
Coughing is a sign of the underlying asthma exacerbation and bronchial hyperreactivity
Increased sputum production
Expectoration of brown-black mucus plugs composed of degenerating eosinophils, desquamated epithelial cells, and mucin
Wheezing
Due to underlying asthma exacerbation and bronchial hyperreactivity
Haemoptysis
Secondary to airway inflammation and
bronchiectasis
Pleuritic chest pain
Occurs in association with cough and increased sputum production
Dyspnea
Weight loss
Fever
In chronic advanced disease, finger clubbing, cyanosis, or features of cor pulmonale may be present.
Few patients with ABPA may have concomitant chronic rhinosinusitis in the form of allergic aspergillus sinusitis and present with nasal obstruction, headache, facial pain, anosmia, epistaxis and nasal discharge.
Improve
Investigations
There is no single test to confirm ABPA, nor is there an individual set of agreed-upon diagnostic criteria.  The following laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures are mandatory and done in a stepwise manner to diagnose ABPA:
Skin test
Skin testing for hypersensitivity to
Aspergillus fumigatus
should be considered for initial screening in patients with suspected ABPA
Skin reactivity to
Aspergillus
is prevalent in 23- 28% patients with asthma and 29% in patients with cystic fibrosis.
A positive skin test with a wheal and flare reaction alone is not specific
Blood tests
Serum-specific IgG and IgE against
Aspergillus fumigatus
The combination of increased total serum and specific IgE allows classic ABPA to be diagnosed with 100% specificity and 64% sensitivity.
Serum total IgE
Increased in patients with ABPA than in those with asthma who have a positive skin test to
Aspergillus fumigatus
, typically >1000 IU/mL
FBC
Eosinophilia is seen in 43-100% of patients, but if the patient is on oral corticosteroid, eosinophilia may not be seen.
Imaging tests
Chest x-ray
Upper/middle lobe infiltrates. Mucus plugging and signs of
bronchiectasis
may also be noted.
CT chest
Helpful in detecting changes and gold standard for diagnosing bronchiectasis
Central bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, mucus impaction, pulmonary infiltrates and peribronchial thickening may be seen. Finger-in-glove sign showing mucoid impaction in bronchioles.
Criteria proposed by the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) working group for diagnosis of ABPA:
1. Predisposing asthma or cystic fibrosis.
2. Obligatory criteria
Type I - positive
Aspergillus
skin test or elevated IgE levels against
Aspergillus fumigatus
and
Elevated total IgE levels (value >1000 IU/mL)
3. Supportive criteria (minimum of two out of three):
Presence of precipitating or IgG antibodies against
Aspergillus fumigatus
in serum
Radiographic pulmonary opacities consistent with ABPA.
Total eosinophil count over 500 cells/µl in glucocorticoid naÃ¯ve patients
Improve
Differential diagnosis
Following are few conditions which must be ruled out before confirming a diagnosis of ABPA:
Asthma exacerbation
Similarities: sign and symptoms of asthma exacerbation like increased cough, dyspnea mimics ABPA
Difference: symptoms like brown mucus plugs and haemoptysis are common in ABPA, but rare in asthma exacerbation. Skin test for sensitivity to
Aspergillus fumigatus
is negative.
Infectious exacerbation of cystic fibrosis
Similarities: clinically infectious exacerbation of cystic fibrosis caused by other micro-organisms is similar to exacerbation of ABPA
Difference: laboratory evaluation may be helpful to distinguish. Serum total IgE and serum-specific IgE and IgG to
Aspergillus fumigatus
is not elevated.
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP)
Similarities: asthma is a common predisposing factor and presents with similar symptoms as ABPA
Differences: bilateral pleural based infiltrates on chest x-ray is pathognomonic of CEP. A negative prick skin test and the absence of precipitins to
Aspergillus
helps to exclude ABPA
Bronchiectasis
Similarities: clinical feature like cough with sputum, dyspnea and repeated infections
Difference: out of many aetiology for bronchiectasis, central bronchiectasis is often seen in ABPA though is a nonspecific finding.

Management
The treatment goals for ABPA include:
Control of symptoms of asthma and cystic fibrosis.
Prevention or treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of ABPA.
Reducing pulmonary inflammation and avoiding progression to end-stage fibrotic or cavitary disease.
The drugs used for the treatment depends on the disease activity and staging of the disease:
Stage 1: acute ABPA
Patients who are symptomatic with fever, cough, increased sputum production, haemoptysis, or chest pain and on investigation shows radiographic opacities and an elevated total serum IgE.
Corticosteroids
Cornerstone therapy.
Resolution of pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary infiltrates, and it prevents irreversible lung damage.
Anti-fungal drug: itraconazole/ voriconazole
Adjunctive but not primary therapy.
Used in adults with severe, poorly controlled asthma and ABPA who are unable to taper oral corticosteroids.
Stage 2: ABPA in remission
Patients who have been treated with oral prednisolone for acute ABPA or exacerbation and are asymptomatic/stable asthma for greater than 6 months after stopping therapy. And also no infiltrates are seen on chest x-ray with normal or mildly elevated total IgE.
Maintenance therapy with inhaled glucocorticoids
Management of underlying asthma or CF
Stage 3: exacerbation of ABPA
Patients who have a 100% rise in serum total IgE over baseline or clinical symptom of acute exacerbation of the underlying condition.
A similar approach as of treatment of acute ABPA with systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids
Stage 4: corticosteroid-dependent asthma
Patients who cannot be weaned off prednisolone without exacerbation of asthma symptoms or persistence of elevated total serum IgE levels. Treatment consists of the following:
Daily oral corticosteroids are given indefinitely
Anti IgE therapy: omalizumab is new emerging therapy used for patients with allergic asthma who have asthma exacerbations despite maximal standard therapy.
Stage 5: end-stage fibrosis
Patients have impaired
respiratory
function and chronic scarring on imaging studies.
Treatment is daily oral corticosteroids given indefinitely
Other additional measures includes:
Environmental control
Patients should be advised to avoid places and environmental conditions with high mould counts.
Comorbid conditions
Any associated comorbid conditions like allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and GORD should be diagnosed and managed for better control of symptoms.

Complications
Although the progression of ABPA is not well understood, complications of ABPA are due to the natural course of the disease or adverse reaction of treatment.
Acute complications
Acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
Recurrent exacerbation of underlying disease namely asthma and CF
Long term complication
Bronchiectasis
Mostly central bronchiectasis resulting in recurrent bacterial infections, haemoptysis, and chronic
respiratory
insufficiency.
Pulmonary fibrosis
Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis
Respiratory failure
Pulmonary hypertension
Treatment-related complication
Side effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy
Includes diabetes, osteopenia, and hyperlipidaemia, immune suppression, cataracts, and growth retardation
