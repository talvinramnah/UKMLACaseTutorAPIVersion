Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Acute
respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by the increased permeability of alveolar capillaries leading to fluid accumulation in the alveoli, i.e. non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. It is a serious condition that has a mortality of around 40% and is associated with significant morbidity in those who survive.

Aetiology
ARDS is a clinical syndrome that can be triggered by a wide range of direct pulmonary injuries and indirect systemic insults. It represents a final common pathway of acute lung injury from diverse aetiologies.
Direct lung injury causes:
Pneumonia (viral, bacterial, fungal) - the most common direct cause
COVID-19 is a significant cause of ARDS
Aspiration of gastric contents
Pulmonary contusion
Inhalation injury
Toxic gas inhalation
Smoke inhalation
Near-drowning
Primary pulmonary vasculitis
Indirect lung injury causes:
Sepsis - the most common overall cause of ARDS
Particularly gram-negative septicaemia
Major trauma with shock and multiple transfusions
Pancreatitis
Major burns
Non-cardiogenic shock
Drug overdose
Opioids
Salicylates
Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
Severe non-thoracic trauma
Cardiopulmonary bypass
Risk Factors
Pre-existing alcohol misuse
Cigarette smoking
Advanced age
Genetic predisposition
Polymorphisms in genes related to inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial function
Obesity
Diabetes mellitus
Chronic liver disease
Modifying Factors
Mechanical ventilation strategies can exacerbate lung injury
High tidal volumes
High airway pressures
Fluid management
Excessive fluid administration may worsen outcomes
Oxygen toxicity
Prolonged exposure to high FiOâ‚‚
NICE guidelines recognise that early identification of patients at risk of developing ARDS is crucial for implementing preventative strategies, particularly in those with sepsis, trauma, or other predisposing conditions.

Clinical features
Acute
Respiratory
Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome characterised by acute onset of hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, in the absence of cardiac failure. The clinical features of ARDS can vary but commonly include:
- Acute Onset: Symptoms usually develop within 1 week of an inciting event or worsening of an existing condition.
-
Dyspnoea
: Shortness of breath is usually the first symptom and is often severe.
- Hypoxemia: Low levels of oxygen in the blood, typically with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300 mmHg.
-
Tachypnoea
- Crackles
-
Tachycardia
- Use of Accessory Muscles
- Cyanosis

Investigations
Diagnostic Approach
ARDS is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on the Berlin Definition criteria, requiring assessment of timing, chest imaging, origin of oedema, and severity of hypoxaemia
Initial investigations should focus on both confirming ARDS and identifying the underlying cause
No single diagnostic test exists for ARDS
- diagnosis requires integration of clinical, radiological and physiological parameters
First-line Investigations
Arterial blood gas (ABG)
Essential for assessing severity of hypoxaemia and calculating PaO2/FiO2 ratio
Severity classification per Berlin criteria: mild (200-300 mmHg), moderate (100-200 mmHg), severe (<100 mmHg)
Also provides information on acid-base status and ventilation (PaCO2)
Chest imaging
Chest X-ray: bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, collapse or nodules
CT chest may be considered if diagnosis is uncertain or to exclude alternative pathologies
Radiological findings often lag behind clinical deterioration
Echocardiography
Critical to exclude cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
Assesses left ventricular function and estimates filling pressures
NICE CG187 recommends echocardiography in all patients with unexplained
respiratory
failure
Microbiological sampling
Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and respiratory tract samples
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be indicated if infection is suspected but standard cultures are negative
Consider testing for viral pathogens including influenza and SARS-CoV-2
Additional Investigations
Biomarkers
No specific biomarkers are validated for routine clinical use in ARDS
Inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) may help identify underlying infection
Lung ultrasound
Can detect B-lines (indicating interstitial oedema), pleural effusions, and consolidation
Increasingly used as a bedside tool for rapid assessment and monitoring
Investigations for underlying cause
Guided by clinical suspicion of the precipitating condition
May include pancreatic enzymes (pancreatitis), toxicology screens (drug-induced), or specific tests for autoimmune conditions
Identifying and treating the underlying cause is crucial for improving outcomes
Improve
Diagnosis
Criteria (American-European Consensus Conference)
acute onset (within 1 week of a known risk factor)
pulmonary oedema: bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray ('not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse or nodules)
non-cardiogenic (pulmonary artery wedge pressure needed if doubt)
pO2/FiO2 < 40kPa (200 mmHg)
Improve
Management
Management
due to the severity of the condition patients are generally managed in ITU
oxygenation/ventilation to treat the hypoxaemia
general organ support e.g. vasopressors as needed
treatment of the underlying cause e.g. antibiotics for sepsis
certain strategies such as prone positioning and muscle relaxation have been shown to improve outcome in ARDS
