Extrinsic allergic alveolitis
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA), also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is an immunologically mediated interstitial lung disease. It results from inhalation of and sensitisation to various organic dusts or specific chemicals in susceptible individuals. These antigens can be derived from numerous sources including bacteria, fungi, animal proteins, and chemical compounds.
The pathogenesis involves both type III and IV hypersensitivity reactions. Acute exposure can lead to symptoms like
fever
, cough, and
dyspnoea
within hours of antigen exposure while chronic EAA manifests with progressive dyspnoea and cough over weeks to months.
Radiological findings are variable but may include ground-glass opacities or nodular or reticular infiltrates on high-resolution computed tomography scan. Lung biopsy is definitive for diagnosis but bronchoalveolar lavage showing lymphocytosis can support the diagnosis. Management includes antigen avoidance and corticosteroids in severe cases.

Aetiology
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA), also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is a complex syndrome of varying intensity, clinical presentation, and course. It is induced by an immune response to the repeated inhalation of various antigens derived from organic dusts or low molecular weight chemicals.
Risk Factors
Occupational Exposure:
Certain occupations have been associated with higher risk of developing EAA due to increased exposure to specific antigens. These include farmers (Farmer's Lung disease), bird breeders (Bird Fancier's Lung), and those working in the malt-processing industry (Malt Worker's Lung).
Environmental Exposure:
Environmental sources of antigenic exposure such as contaminated heating or air conditioning systems can cause EAA (Humidifier or Air-conditioner Lung).
Hobbies:
Certain hobbies can lead to antigen exposure and subsequent development of EAA. Examples include keeping birds as pets, playing wind instruments contaminated with moulds, or using hot tubs infected with
Mycobacterium avium
.
Genetic Predisposition:
There is evidence suggesting that certain HLA types are associated with susceptibility to develop EAA when exposed to relevant antigens.
Underlying Causes
The underlying cause of EAA is primarily an immunological reaction to inhaled antigens. The nature of these antigens varies widely but they are typically proteins or glycoproteins derived from bacteria, fungi, animal dander or plant material.
Micropolyspora faeni
,
Thermoactinomyces vulgaris
, and
Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula
are common fungal antigens associated with Farmer's Lung disease.
Bird Fancier's Lung is typically caused by antigens derived from avian proteins present in bird droppings or feathers, particularly pigeons and budgerigars.
Malt Worker's Lung is caused by
Aspergillus clavatus
, a fungus found in malt dust.
Humidifier or Air-conditioner Lung can be caused by a variety of antigens including bacteria such as
Bacillus subtilis
and thermophilic actinomycetes, and fungi such as
Aureobasidium pullulans
.
In susceptible individuals, these antigens induce an immune response leading to inflammation and damage within the lung parenchyma. The precise pathophysiology involves both type III (immune complex-mediated) and type IV (delayed-type hypersensitivity) reactions, although the relative contribution of each varies between patients and antigen types.

Pathophysiology
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA), also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is a complex lung disease resulting from an immune response to the inhalation of various environmental antigens. The pathophysiology of EAA involves intricate immunological mechanisms and can be divided into four stages: antigen exposure, sensitisation, acute inflammatory reaction, and chronic inflammation leading to fibrosis.
Antigen Exposure
The process begins with the inhalation of small (<5 µm) antigenic particles. These particles can be derived from a variety of sources such as moulds, bacteria, animal proteins or chemicals.
Due to their size, these particles are capable of reaching the alveoli where they interact with the alveolar epithelium and resident immune cells.
Sensitisation
The inhaled antigens are processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like macrophages and dendritic cells present in the lung parenchyma.
These APCs present the antigens to T lymphocytes which leads to their activation. This stage is marked by a Th1/Th17 predominant immune response characterised by release of cytokines such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-17 etc.
Acute Inflammatory Reaction
On re-exposure to the same antigen, activated T-cells recognise it and mount an inflammatory response.
This acute phase is characterised by neutrophilic infiltration in alveoli leading to diffuse alveolitis. Cytokines released during this phase cause increased vascular permeability resulting in protein-rich fluid accumulation within alveoli leading to impaired gas exchange.
Chronic Inflammation and Fibrosis
If the exposure to antigen continues, it leads to persistent inflammation and progression to a chronic stage.
This stage is marked by lymphocytic alveolitis and granuloma formation. Over time, repeated injury and repair cycles lead to fibrotic changes in the lung parenchyma.
The end result is
pulmonary fibrosis
characterised by loss of normal lung architecture, decreased compliance, impaired gas exchange leading to hypoxia and
respiratory
failure.
The clinical manifestations of EAA largely depend on the stage of disease progression. Acute episodes are characterised by symptoms such as
fever
, cough,
dyspnoea
which occur several hours after antigen exposure. Chronic EAA presents with insidious onset of breathlessness, weight loss,
fatigue
and features of pulmonary fibrosis on imaging. The key pathological findings include interstitial infiltrates with lymphocytes and plasma cells, non-caseating granulomas in lung parenchyma and varying degrees of fibrosis in advanced stages.

Clinical features
A thorough clinical history is essential. This must include an occupational history, as certain jobs are associated with exposure to agents that can cause EEA:
Farmers
Particularly mushroom and potato workers, compost workers
Animal cleaning/breeding
Particularly avian species
Chemical industry
Working with paints, powders
Smelters and hard metal workers
A particular focus on exposure at home or at work to moulds is important, including in ventilators, air conditioners, hay or wood as this is a common causative agent.
The presentation may be
acute
, with symptoms presenting 4-8 hours after exposure to causative agent and subsiding within 24-48 hours, or
chronic
, usually following long term low-exposure to a causative agent.
Acute
EEA typically presents, alongside a suggestive occupational/exposure history, with:
Cough (productive or non-productive)
Dyspnoea
Fever
Malaise
Chest tightness
Acute type 1
respiratory
failure may develop in severe cases
Chronic
EEA presents more insidiously, alongside a suggestive occupational/exposure history, with:
Insidious cough/dyspnoea symptoms
Weight loss
Clubbing (50% of cases)
More widespread fibrotic changes mimicking idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis
On auscultation of the lungs in both cases, bilateral midzone inspiratory crepitations will likely be heard to a greater or lesser extent depending on the severity of the condition.
Improve
Investigations
The diagnosis of EEA is challenging as it can present insidiously, and there is no gold standard test. It is, therefore, a combination of clinical, radiological and lung function test findings.
Blood Tests
Routine tests reveal largely non-specific findings but are important to rule out an infectious process.
Full blood count
May show a mildly increased WCC and normocytic anaemia
Arterial blood gas
Patients with acute hypoxia secondary to EEA may develop type 1
respiratory
failure
Serum precipitant antibodies
If there is a known, probable precipitant (e.g. suggestive symptoms in a pigeon farmer), then measuring serum IgG antibody of the precipitant can confirm humoral response to it, and diagnosis of EEA. It can also be used to track response to treatment
In other cases where the link with a precipitant is less clear, however, serum antibody is of less use
Imaging
Chest X-Ray (CXR)
May show non-specific ground-glass changes, airspace consolidation, or interstitial opacities
High-resolution CT (HRCT) chest. Suggestive clinical history and CXR should lead to a review by the respiratory team and further imaging with HRCT to investigate further. However, HRCT may be normal in 8-18% of patients with EEA. Common features include:
Patchy, diffuse, symmetrical ground glass opacities
Small (<5mm) centrilobular nodules
Patchy air trapping on expiratory imaging
Airspace consolidation
Changes are typically bilaterally in the mid-zones
Lung function tests
Lung function tests in acute EEA demonstrate a restrictive picture
A reduction in both FEV1 and FVC, but with FEV1/FVC>80% expected
However, chronic EEA may show features of obstructive lung disease
The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) will also likely be decreased in EEA
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
Fluid from BAL can be analysed for causative agents and antigens to that agent
A negative BAL does not rule out EEA in the presence of positive lung function testing, HRCT and clinical history
There is also generalised lymphocytosis on BAL culture
Improve
Differential diagnosis
Key differentials are from other forms of interstitial lung disease or infectious lung disease
Idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF)
The most likely and clinically similar condition, that needs to be ruled out when EEA is suspected
EEA's pattern of exposure correlating with symptomatic recurrence is a key differentiating feature on the history to help distinguish between the two conditions
Furthermore, BAL in IPF is less likely to demonstrate the typical leucocytosis of seen in EEA
Pneumonia
Viral pneumonia is likely to be associated with a
dry cough
and
fever
, and should not recur in contrast to the natural history of EEA that is characterised by repeated short recurrences
Similarly, bacterial pneumonia will usually be accompanied by frank lobar consolidation on CXR and productive cough
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD)
Chronic, progressive
dyspnoea
with cough and reduced exercise tolerance. No periods of symptoms improvement in the natural history of the disease.
Key risk factor is smoking, and age over 60 years
Typically a hyperinflated chest is seen on x-ray, with an obstructive picture on spirometry (FEV1/FVC <70%, reduced DLCO)
Sarcoidosis
A rarer auto-immune condition
Clinical features of sarcoidosis may be very similar to EEA, but with the important addition of extra-pulmonary features associated with sarcoidosis
These include painless cervical lymphadenopathy, red and painful eye, and arthralgia
Asbestosis
A rare condition following worldwide campaigns to remove asbestos from homes and workplaces
Clinical symptoms are likely very similar to EEA, but with a history of asbestos exposure
Imaging shows pathognomonic pleural plaques
Improve
Management
British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines on interstitial lung disease (2008) underline the key factor in management is the identification and avoidance of the precipitating agent.
Identification by a thorough clinical history including occupational hazards and correlation with symptom timeline of the patient.
A causative agent may not be able to be identified in up to 25% of cases
BAL cytology or antigen testing of the blood may confirm the causative agent
Once identified, the removal of the causative agent is the most important part of management, and symptoms should resolve following this.
Liaison with the employer and occupational health if the agent is work-related, and with the provision of
respiratory
masks and other protective equipment may be necessary
Corticosteroids
A trial of corticosteroids e.g. oral prednisolone can help with symptoms, mostly in patients with equivocal clinical presentation, as EEA tends to be steroid-responsive, whereas idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis
does not
This should then be tapered over a period of several weeks
Patients with chronic EEA may benefit from long-term low dose prednisolone
Improve
Complications
Fibrotic and emphysematous changes following inflammation in the lung during an acute period may lead to fibrosis, which has long term effects. Studies have found that 20% of patients with farmer's lung (EEA secondary to occupational exposure to hay dust or mould spores) developed
emphysema
.
Chronic oxygen requirement
Widespread fibrosis may result in chronic hypoxaemia requiring long-term oxygen therapy at home
Decreased lung function will lead to a reduced ability to carry out physical activities and activities of daily living
