Phaeochromocytoma
Phaeochromocytoma
Phaeochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine neoplasm arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, characterized by catecholamine hypersecretion. These tumours may also develop at extra-adrenal sites, known as paragangliomas. The classic triad of symptoms includes episodic
headache
, diaphoresis, and tachycardia; however, clinical presentation can be highly variable.
The diagnostic workup involves biochemical confirmation with plasma or urinary fractionated metanephrines followed by cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) for localization.
Definitive management entails surgical resection via laparoscopic adrenalectomy or open approach depending on tumour size and location. Preoperative alpha-blockade (phenoxybenzamine) is essential to mitigate perioperative hypertensive crises secondary to catecholamine release.

Pathophysiology
bout 10% are familial and may be associated with MEN type II, neurofibromatosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
Basics
bilateral in 10%
malignant in 10%
extra-adrenal in 10% (most common site = organ of Zuckerkandl, adjacent to the bifurcation of the aorta)

Investigations
Biochemical confirmation
24 hr urinary collection of metanephrines (sensitivity 97%)
this has replaced a 24 hr urinary collection of catecholamines (sensitivity 86%)
Cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) for localization.
Functional imaging modalities like MIBG scintigraphy or PET scans may be employed in cases of metastatic or extra-adrenal disease.
Genetic testing is recommended given the high rate of heritable mutations associated with these tumours (e.g., RET, VHL, NF1).

Management
Surgery is the definitive management. The patient must first however be stabilized with medical management:
alpha-blocker (e.g. phenoxybenzamine), given before a
beta-blocker (e.g. propranolol)
