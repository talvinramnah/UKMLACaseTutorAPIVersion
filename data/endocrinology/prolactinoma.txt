Prolactinoma
Prolactinoma
Prolactinoma is a type of pituitary adenoma that results in the overproduction of prolactin hormone. It is the most common type of pituitary tumour. The symptoms of prolactinoma are related to the excess prolactin hormone and include menstrual irregularities,
infertility
, decreased libido,
galactorrhoea
, and osteoporosis. In men, it can cause
erectile dysfunction
and decreased testosterone levels. Diagnosis is made through blood tests to measure prolactin levels and imaging studies.
In the majority of cases, symptomatic patients are successfully treated medically with dopamine agonists. Surgery is performed for patients who cannot tolerate or fail to respond to medical therapy.
