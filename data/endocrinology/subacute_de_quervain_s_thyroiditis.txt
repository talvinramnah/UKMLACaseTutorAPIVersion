Subacute (De Quervain's) thyroiditis
Subacute thyroiditis (also known as De Quervain's thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis) is thought to occur following viral infection and typically presents with hyperthyroidism.

Clinical features
There are typically 4 phases;
phase 1 (lasts 3-6 weeks): hyperthyroidism, painful
goitre
, raised ESR
phase 2 (1-3 weeks): euthyroid
phase 3 (weeks - months): hypothyroidism
phase 4: thyroid structure and function goes back to normal

Management
Management of Subacute (De Quervain's) thyroiditis primarily revolves around symptomatic relief and controlling the inflammatory process. The following steps should be considered:
Analgesia:
Start with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control pain and inflammation in mild cases.
Corticosteroids:
In more severe cases, or if NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective, consider prednisolone. Tapering the dose over a few weeks is recommended once symptoms improve.
Beta-blockers:
If patients exhibit thyrotoxic symptoms such as
palpitations
, tremors or anxiety, beta-blockers can be beneficial. Propranolol is often used due to its additional benefit of reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.
In terms of monitoring thyroid function:
Hypothyroid phase:
Following the initial thyrotoxic phase, patients may enter a hypothyroid phase which usually resolves spontaneously within a few weeks to months. However, temporary levothyroxine replacement may be required in some patients if they become symptomatic.
Long term follow-up:
Although most patients will return to euthyroid status, regular thyroid function tests should be performed for at least 12 months post-episode as there is a risk of developing permanent hypothyroidism.
Note that radioactive iodine uptake is typically low in De Quervain's thyroiditis and thus this modality should not be used for diagnosis or treatment. Similarly, antithyroid medications are not indicated as the thyrotoxicosis in De Quervainâ€™s thyroiditis is due to release of preformed thyroid hormone rather than increased hormone synthesis.
