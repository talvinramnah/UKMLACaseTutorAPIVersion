Photophobia may be present in cases of viral
conjunctivitis
.
Watery discharge in viral conjunctivitis, while purulent or mucopurulent discharge is more indicative of bacterial conjunctivitis.
Signs
Conjunctival injection and chemosis.
Eyelid swelling and erythema.
Palpable preauricular lymphadenopathy, particularly in viral conjunctivitis.
Subconjunctival haemorrhage may be present in cases of adenoviral conjunctivitis.

Management
Management of infective
conjunctivitis
normally a self-limiting condition that usually settles without treatment within 1-2 weeks
topical antibiotic therapy is commonly offered to patients, e.g. Chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol drops are given 2-3 hourly initially where as chloramphenicol ointment is given qds initially
topical fusidic acid is an alternative and should be used for pregnant women. Treatment is twice daily
contact lens should not be worn during an episode of conjunctivitis
advice should be given not to share towels
