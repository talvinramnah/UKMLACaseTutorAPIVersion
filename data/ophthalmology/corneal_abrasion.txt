Corneal abrasion
Corneal abrasion
Corneal abrasions refer to any defect of the corneal epithelium and most commonly come about from a recent history of local trauma (e.g. finger nail, branches).

Clinical features
Common clinical findings include
eye pain
,
photophobia
, decreased visual acuity in the affected eye, foreign body sensation and conjunctival injection.
Fluorescein examination typically reveals a yellow stained abrasion (representative of the de-epithelialized surface) which is usually visible to the naked eye.

Management
Aims of Treatment
The primary aims of corneal abrasion management are to:
Promote rapid re-epithelialization
Prevent infection
Relieve pain
Prevent complications
Most uncomplicated corneal abrasions heal within 24-72 hours with appropriate treatment
Initial Management
Topical antibiotics
are recommended for all corneal abrasions to prevent infection
Chloramphenicol eye drops or ointment is typically first-line in UK practice
Alternatives include fusidic acid gel for patients with chloramphenicol allergy
The College of Optometrists' Clinical Management Guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for all corneal abrasions
Pain management
is essential as corneal abrasions can be extremely painful
Oral analgesia (paracetamol, NSAIDs) is usually sufficient
Topical NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac drops) may provide additional pain relief
Avoid topical anaesthetics for pain control as they delay healing and mask complications
Eye patching
is no longer routinely recommended
Evidence suggests patching does not improve healing rates and may delay epithelial regeneration
NICE CKS guidance states: "Do not patch the eye as this does not improve healing or reduce pain"
Special Considerations
Contact lens wearers
require special attention
Higher risk of
microbial keratitis
, particularly from Pseudomonas
Broader spectrum antibiotic coverage may be indicated
Contact lens wear should be discontinued until complete healing and follow-up assessment
Referral criteria
for
ophthalmology
assessment:
Large or central abrasions affecting visual axis
Suspected retained foreign body
Signs of infection (purulent discharge, stromal infiltrate)
Failure to improve after 48 hours of treatment
History of high-velocity injury or chemical exposure
Follow-up
is recommended for:
Large or central abrasions
Contact lens-related abrasions
Patients with persistent symptoms after 48 hours
Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or if they develop increased pain, decreased vision, or purulent discharge
