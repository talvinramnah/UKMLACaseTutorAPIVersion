Primary open-angle glaucoma
Primary open-angle glaucoma
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, leading to irreversible
visual field loss
. The pathogenesis of POAG involves a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and vascular factors resulting in increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and subsequent mechanical stress on the optic nerve head.
The hallmark clinical features of POAG include an open iridocorneal angle on gonioscopy, characteristic glaucomatous optic disc cupping with thinning of the neuroretinal rim, and corresponding visual field defects. Elevated IOP remains the most significant risk factor for developing POAG; however, it should be noted that a considerable proportion of patients may present with normal-tension glaucoma, where IOP lies within the statistically normal range.
Diagnosis relies on comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation including tonometry, fundus examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT) for retinal nerve fibre layer assessment, and perimetry to detect visual field changes.
Management primarily focuses on lowering the IOP. Topical medications such as prostaglandin analogues, beta-blockers or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are commonly used but laser trabeculoplasty is increasingly used in selected patients as the first-line treatment.

Aetiology
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG, also referred to as chronic simple glaucoma) is present in around 2% of people older than 40 years. Other than age, risk factors include:
genetics: first degree relatives of an open-angle glaucoma patient have a 16% chance of developing the disease
black patients
myopia
hypertension
diabetes mellitus
corticosteroids

Pathophysiology
Glaucomas can be classified based on whether the peripheral iris is covering the trabecular meshwork, which is important in the drainage of aqueous humour from the anterior chamber of the eye. In open-angle glaucoma, the iris is clear of the meshwork. The trabecular network functionally offers an increased resistance to aqueous outflow, causing increased IOP. It is now recognised that a minority of patients with raised IOP do not have glaucoma and vice versa.

Clinical features
POAG may present insidiously and for this reason is often detected during routine optometry appointments. Features may include
peripheral
visual field loss
- nasal scotomas progressing to 'tunnel vision'
decreased visual acuity
optic disc cupping
Fundoscopy signs of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG):
1. Optic disc cupping - cup-to-disc ratio >0.7 (normal = 0.4-0.7), occurs as loss of disc substance makes optic cup widen and deepen
2. Optic disc pallor - indicating
optic atrophy
3. Bayonetting of vessels - vessels have breaks as they disappear into the deep cup and re-appear at the base
4. Additional features - Cup notching (usually inferior where vessels enter disc), Disc haemorrhages
Diagnosis:
Case finding and provisional diagnosis is done by an optometrist
Referral to the ophthalmologist is done via the GP
Final diagnosis is done by investigations as below
Improve
Investigations
Investigations:
automated perimetry to assess visual field
slit lamp examination with pupil dilatation to assess optic neve and fundus for a baseline
applanation tonometry to measure IOP
central corneal thickness measurement
gonioscopy to assess peripheral anterior chamber configuration and depth
Assess risk of future visual impairment,
using risk factors such as IOP, central corneal thickness (CCT), family history, life expectancy
Improve
Management
The aim of treatment is to lower intra-ocular pressure which in turn has been shown to prevent progressive loss of visual field.
NICE guidelines
offer
360Â° selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT)
first-line to people with an IOP of ≥ 24 mmHg
NICE
360Â° SLT can delay the need for eye drops and can reduce but does not remove the chance they will be needed at all
a second 360Â° SLT procedure may be needed at a later date
prostaglandin analogue (PGA) eyedrops should be used next-line
NICE
the next line of treatments includes:
beta-blocker eye drops
carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
eye drops
sympathomimetic eye drops
surgery in the form of a trabeculectomy may be considered in refractory cases.
Medication
Mode of action
Notes
Prostaglandin analogues (e.g.
latanoprost
)
Increases uveoscleral outflow
Once daily administration
Adverse effects include
brown pigmentation of the iris, increased eyelash length
Beta-blockers (e.g. timolol,
betaxolol
)
Reduces aqueous production
Should be avoided in asthmatics and patients with heart block
Sympathomimetics (e.g. brimonidine, an
alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist
)
Reduces aqueous production and increases outflow
Avoid if taking MAOI or tricyclic antidepressants
Adverse effects include hyperaemia
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. Dorzolamide)
Reduces aqueous production
Systemic absorption may cause sulphonamide-like reactions
Miotics (e.g. pilocarpine, a
muscarinic receptor agonist
)
Increases uveoscleral outflow
Adverse effects included a constricted pupil, headache and blurred vision
