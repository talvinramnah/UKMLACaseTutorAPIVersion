Subconjunctival haemorrhage
Subconjunctival haemorrhage
Subconjunctival haemorrhage is a common condition that occurs when blood vessels in the conjunctiva, the thin membrane covering the white part of the eye, rupture and bleed. The condition is usually painless and does not affect vision. It can be caused by trauma, coughing, sneezing, high blood pressure, or blood-thinning medications. In most cases, subconjunctival haemorrhage resolves on its own within two weeks without any treatment.

Clinical features
Symptoms:
Red-eye, usually unilateral
Subconjunctival haemorrhages are mostly asymptomatic, however mild irritation may be present
Signs:
Flat, red patch on the conjunctiva. It will have well-defined edges and normal conjunctiva surrounding it. Patches can vary in size depending on the size of the bleed, and can involve the whole conjunctiva
Traumatic haemorrhages are most common in the temporal region (40.5%), with the inferior conjunctiva as the next most commonly affected area
Vision should be normal, including acuity, visual fields and range of eye movements
On examination, the fundus should be normal

Management
Management:
Reassure the patient that whilst a subconjunctival haemorrhage may look alarming, it is a benign condition that will resolve on its own in 2 to 3 weeks. If the patient presents to services immediately after the haemorrhage occurs, it can spread over a couple of days until it begins to resolve. The colour of the patch may change to yellow/ green, like a bruise, but preparing the patient for this will prevent any alarm if this happens.
If the cause is traumatic consider a referral to the ophthalmologist to ensure no other damage has been caused to the eye
Advise the patient to consult their GP if this happens again because, as previously mentioned, recurrent subconjunctival haemorrhages warrant investigations for bleeding disorders or other potential pathology
Artificial tears can be used for a couple of weeks if there is any mild irritation
