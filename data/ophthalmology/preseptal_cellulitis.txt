Preseptal cellulitis
Preseptal cellulitis
Preseptal cellulitis is sometimes also referred to as periorbital cellulitis. It is an infection of the soft tissues anterior to the orbital septum - this includes the eyelids, skin and subcutaneous tissue of the face, but not the contents of the orbit. This is in contrast to
orbital cellulitis
, which is an infection of the soft tissues behind the orbital septum, and is a much more serious infection.

Pathophysiology
Infection usually spreads to the structures surrounding the orbit from other nearby sites, most commonly from breaks in the skin or local infections such as sinusitis or other respiratory tract infections. The most frequently causative organisms are
Staph. aureus
,
Staph. epidermidis
, streptococci and anaerobic bacteria.

Clinical features
Symptoms
The patient presents with a red, swollen, painful eye of acute onset. They are likely to have symptoms associated with
fever
.
Signs
Erythema and oedema of the eyelids, which can spread onto the surrounding skin
Partial or complete ptosis of the eye due to swelling
Orbital signs (pain on movement of the eye, restriction of eye movements, proptosis, visual disturbance, chemosis, RAPD) must be absent in preseptal cellulitis - their presence would indicate
orbital cellulitis

Management
Management of preseptal cellulitis primarily involves antibiotic therapy, typically oral antibiotics for mild to moderate cases and intravenous antibiotics for severe cases or those unresponsive to oral treatment. The choice of antibiotic should cover common causative organisms such as
Staphylococcus aureus
and
Streptococcus pneumoniae
.
Oral Antibiotics:
For mild to moderate cases, oral antibiotics are usually sufficient. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is commonly used. In patients allergic to penicillins, clarithromycin or erythromycin can be used.
Intravenous Antibiotics:
Severe cases may necessitate hospital admission for intravenous antibiotics. Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime are often chosen. In the presence of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) risk factors, vancomycin or teicoplanin should be added.
Surgical Intervention:
Although rare, surgical intervention may be required in the case of an abscess formation that does not respond to medical management alone.
Clinical improvement should be seen within 48 hours of initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy. If no improvement is observed, reassess the patient and consider alternative diagnoses such as
orbital cellulitis
.
