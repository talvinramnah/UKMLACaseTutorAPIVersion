Central retinal vein occlusion
Central retinal vein occlusion
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common cause of painless loss of vision, affecting an estimated 16 million people worldwide. Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is around 4 times less common than branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and typically results from thrombus occlusion of the central retinal vein. This mostly occurs unilaterally, although 10% of patients may subsequently develop contralateral RVO. CRVO can be further classified into ischaemic and non-ischaemic groups, delineating distinct prognoses and treatment strategies.

Aetiology
Risk factors for systemic thrombosis all are important risk factors for the development of retinal vein occlusion, as well as glaucoma. Risk factors for developing ischaemic and non-ischaemic CRVO are the same.
Both thrombus formation in the lumen of the central retinal vein, and thrombus in the central retinal artery compressing on the adjacent retinal vein, can cause CRVO.
However, development of retinal vein occlusion has not been shown to be a predictor of subsequent stroke.
No difference in prevalence of CRVO between men and women has been demonstrated.
The prevalence of CRVO increases with age.
Disorders of coagulation and systemic auto-inflammatory conditions (e.g. (Bechet's disease, polyarteritis nodosa, sarcoidosis) are also risk factors.
Rarely, retrobulbar compression of the retinal vein can cause compression e.g. from thyroid eye disease, orbital tumour or retrobulbar haemorrhage.

Pathophysiology
Visual loss
in CRVO is secondary to the development of macular oedema. This develops following the venous occlusion.
Thrombosis in the retinal vein causes increased pressure in the vessels draining from the eye
This causes transudation of blood products into the retina from the venous capillary beds, leading to increased interstitial oncotic pressure that results in macular oedema and capillary ischaemia.
Retinal ischaemia induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other soluble cytokine production from retinal pigment epithelial cells.
These factors promote vascular permeability and neovascularization, contributing to macular oedema and further exacerbating retinal ischaemia.
The degree to which collateral vessels form, allowing for alternative venous drainage routes and the degree to which macular oedema has developed at presentation determines categorisation into ischaemic or non-ischaemic CRVO.
For example, total CRVO in a patient with well-developed collaterals may present with only mild visual acuity deficits and macular oedema.
Any patient with CRVO that has developed neovascularization at the angle has by definition already developed ischaemic CRVO.

Clinical features
Typical Clinical Presentation
CRVO characteristically presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye.
The visual impairment is often noticed on waking or develops over several hours.
Pain is generally absent; the presence of ocular pain suggests an alternative diagnosis (e.g. acute angle-closure glaucoma).
Visual loss
may range from mild to severe and can be described as blurred or dimmed vision.
Some patients report a scotoma or patchy areas of missing vision.
Rarely, there may be transient visual obscurations prior to permanent loss.
Ophthalmic Findings
On examination, the following signs are typical:
Decreased visual acuity in the affected eye.
Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), especially in ischaemic CRVO.
Fundoscopy reveals classic features:
Diffuse retinal haemorrhages ("blood and thunder" appearance)
Dilated and tortuous retinal veins
Optic disc swelling
Cotton wool spots
Macular oedema (may be subtle or pronounced)
Occasionally, neovascularisation of the iris or retina in advanced/ischaemic cases
Differentiating Ischaemic and Non-Ischaemic CRVO
Non-ischaemic CRVO (approximately 70% of cases):
Typically presents with milder reduction in visual acuity
Fewer cotton wool spots and less extensive retinal haemorrhage
Lower risk of neovascular complications at presentation
Ischaemic CRVO:
Presents with severe, sudden visual loss
RAPD usually present
Extensive retinal haemorrhage, numerous cotton wool spots, marked optic disc swelling
High risk for early neovascularisation and secondary neovascular glaucoma

Investigations
Although largely a clinical diagnosis, blood tests can help guide ongoing risk-factor management, and imaging can determine the degree of severity.
Blood tests:
FBC
May indicate hyperviscosity, e.g. thrombocytosis
Lipid profile
Identification of modifiable risk factors
ESR
A raised ESR prompts suspicious of systemic inflammatory disorder and auto-antibody screen
Fasting glucose, Hba1c
Diabetic screen or assessment of glycaemic control
Imaging:
Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) will be done to at presentation measure areas of capillary non-perfusion. This confirms the diagnosis and can assess the severity of the condition.
Distinguishes between subtypes of CRVO.
Non-ischaemic CRVO = presence of <10 areas of non-perfusion
Ischaemic CRVO = presence of >=10 areas of non-perfusion
Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
Confirms extent of macular oedema
Can be used to monitor the response of macular oedema to treatment
Further ophthalmological clinical examination:
Slit-lamp examination
To further assess the anterior and posterior segments of the eye
Neovascularisation of the iris indicates severe ischaemic CRVO
Gonioscopy
To evaluate for the angle for glaucoma and neovascularisation
Improve
Differential diagnosis
There are multiple differentials for sudden painless loss of vision. If there is any accompanying peripheral or central neurological deficit, cerebral vascular accident should be ruled out.
Otherwise, the key ophthalmological differentials are:
Branch retinal venous occlusion
A key differential is branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) - this occurs when a vein in the distal retinal venous system is occluded and is thought to occur due to blockage of retinal veins at arteriovenous crossings. It results in a more limited area of the fundus being affected.
Differentiated by clinical examination (macular oedema is infrequently seen on fundoscopy) and imaging (fundus fluorescein angiography demonstrates only single-quadrant non-perfusion areas)
Treatment goals are similar, monitoring for signs of ischaemic changes warranting anti-VEGF or PRP treatment.
Retinal detachment
Sudden, painless, usually central loss of vision
Patients often experience floaters or photopsia, which are very unusual in CRVO
Area of detachment seen on fundoscopy
Diabetic retinopathy
Key risk factors present in clinical history, higher risk amongst patients with diabetes with suboptimal glycaemic control
Bilateral signs in diabetic retinopathy, important differentiating factor from CRVO in which unilateral symptoms are far more common
Fundoscopy demonstrates micro-aneurysms
Ischaemic optic syndrome (IOS)
Carotid artery stenosis leads to ocular hypoperfusion.
Rarer but important differential as risk of
visual loss
and hypoperfusion of other cerebral areas
Key differentiating factors on fundoscopy are microaneurysms on (common in IOS), and macular oedema (rare in IOS).

Management
Initial Management
Prompt referral to
ophthalmology
is essential for all suspected cases of CRVO
Patients should be seen within 24 hours if possible
Delay in treatment may result in irreversible
visual loss
Risk factor modification should be initiated
Hypertension control
Diabetes management
Lipid-lowering therapy where indicated
Smoking cessation
Antiplatelet therapy may be considered
Aspirin is commonly used unless contraindicated
No strong evidence for anticoagulation unless specific thrombophilia identified
Treatment of Macular Oedema
Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is the
first-line treatment
for macular oedema secondary to CRVO
Ranibizumab, aflibercept, or bevacizumab may be used according to local protocols
Treatment typically involves a loading phase of monthly injections followed by a treat-and-extend regimen
Regular OCT monitoring guides retreatment decisions
Intravitreal corticosteroids are considered second-line therapy
Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) may be used in patients unresponsive to anti-VEGF therapy
Particularly useful in pseudophakic patients or those unsuitable for frequent injections
Requires monitoring for steroid-induced glaucoma and cataract progression
Laser therapy has a limited role in macular oedema management
Grid laser photocoagulation is generally not recommended as primary therapy
Management of Ischaemic CRVO
Regular monitoring for neovascularisation is essential
Review every 4-6 weeks initially, then every 2-3 months if stable
Gonioscopy to assess for angle neovascularisation
Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is indicated for:
Neovascularisation of the iris (NVI)
Neovascularisation of the angle (NVA)
Neovascular glaucoma
Anti-VEGF therapy may be used as an adjunct to PRP
Can provide rapid regression of neovascularisation
May be used as a temporising measure before PRP
Neovascular glaucoma management
Topical IOP-lowering medications
Cyclodiode laser therapy for refractory cases
Glaucoma drainage surgery may be required in severe cases
Long-term follow-up is required for all CRVO patients
Non-ischaemic CRVO may convert to ischaemic CRVO (up to 30% of cases)
Regular monitoring for development of complications
Ongoing assessment of the fellow eye (10% risk of bilateral involvement)
