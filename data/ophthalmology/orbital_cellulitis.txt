Orbital cellulitis
Orbital cellulitis
Orbital cellulitis is the result of an infection affecting the fat and muscles posterior to the orbital septum, within the orbit but not involving the globe.  It is usually caused by a spreading upper respiratory tract infection from the sinuses and carries a high mortality rate. Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency requiring hospital admission and urgent senior review. Periorbital (preseptal) cellulitis is a less serious superficial infection anterior to the orbital septum, resulting from a superficial tissue injury (chalazion, insect bite etc...).
Periorbital cellulitis
can progress to orbital cellulitis.

Clinical features
The clinical features of orbital cellulitis are grouped into five classic signs, collectively known as the '5 P's'.
Pain:
Pain is a prominent feature of orbital cellulitis and is usually described as throbbing or a deep ache. The pain often intensifies with eye movements and can radiate to the forehead, cheek, or teeth.
Proptosis
(Exophthalmos):
This refers to a forward displacement or protrusion of the eyeball. It is due to inflammation and oedema of the orbital contents, or in severe cases, formation of an abscess. Proptosis can be assessed clinically by lateral inspection or measured with an exophthalmometer.
Periocular Swelling (Oedema):
Periocular swelling and redness result from the inflammatory response within the orbital tissues. The patient may present with
swollen eyelids
,
chemosis
(swelling of the conjunctiva), and erythema. It's crucial to distinguish this sign from
preseptal cellulitis
, which affects only the eyelid and periorbital tissues, without the involvement of the orbital contents.
Pupil Involvement and Visual Changes:
This may present as blurred vision, decreased visual acuity,
diplopia
(double vision), or even loss of vision in severe, advanced cases. A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) may be present, indicating optic nerve involvement. These features necessitate urgent attention, given the risk of permanent vision loss.
Palsy (
Ophthalmoplegia
):
Due to the inflammation and swelling in the orbit, there can be restriction or paralysis of the extraocular muscles, leading to impaired eye movements (ophthalmoplegia). This can further contribute to the complaint of diplopia.
Additional Symptoms:
Fever
,
malaise
, and other systemic symptoms may be present, reflecting the underlying infectious process. The patient may also have signs of the primary infection, such as sinusitis.

Investigations
Investigations
Full blood count - WBC elevated, raised inflammatory markers.
Clinical examination involving complete ophthalmological assessment - Decreased vision, afferent pupillary defect,
proptosis
, dysmotility, oedema, erythema.
CT with contrast - Inflammation of the orbital tissues deep to the septum, sinusitis.
Blood culture and microbiological swab to determine the organism. Most common bacterial causes -
Streptococcus
,
Staphylococcus aureus
,
Haemophilus influenzae B
.
