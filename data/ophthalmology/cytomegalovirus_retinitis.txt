Cytomegalovirus retinitis
Cytomegalovirus retinitis
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is common, affecting 30-40% of patients who have a CD4 count < 50. Diagnosis is clinical as there are no diagnostic tests

Clinical features
A stereotypical presentation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis involves a patient with advanced immunosuppression, most commonly in the context of untreated or late-stage HIV infection with a CD4 count less than 50 cells/μL. Patients typically present with
painless, progressive visual loss
in one eye, although bilateral involvement may occur if left untreated.
The initial symptom is often blurred vision or a scotoma (area of partial vision loss), which may be accompanied by floaters.
In some cases, patients may notice reduced peripheral vision or difficulty reading.
There is usually an absence of ocular pain or photophobia, distinguishing CMV retinitis from other causes of infectious retinitis.
Ophthalmic Examination Findings
Fundoscopy reveals characteristic retinal lesions:
Areas of
full-thickness retinal necrosis
with yellow-white granular opacification and associated haemorrhages ("pizza pie" or "cottage cheese and ketchup" appearance).
Lesions typically begin at the posterior pole and progress centrifugally along the vascular arcades.
Retinal vasculitis and perivascular sheathing are common.
Minimal to no vitritis is seen compared to other viral retinitides such as acute retinal necrosis.
Course and Complications
Without treatment, lesions enlarge over weeks to months, leading to increasing visual field defects and potentially total blindness due to retinal detachment.
Secondary complications include optic nerve involvement resulting in further visual impairment.
Painless progressive visual loss in a severely immunocompromised patient should prompt urgent consideration of CMV retinitis.
Early ophthalmological assessment is essential to confirm the diagnosis and prevent irreversible sight loss.

Management
- The primary aim of management is to preserve vision by suppressing viral replication and preventing progression of retinal necrosis. Early treatment is essential to minimise irreversible visual loss.
Management should be coordinated with an HIV specialist, as CMV retinitis almost exclusively occurs in the context of advanced immunosuppression.
Antiviral therapy
First-line treatment is systemic antiviral therapy. Intravitreal therapy may be considered in certain circumstances.
Oral valganciclovir is usually preferred for induction and maintenance due to its efficacy and convenience (
NICE NG203
).
Intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet are alternatives where oral absorption is unreliable, or in severe sight-threatening disease.
Intravitreal ganciclovir injections can provide rapid local control, especially in cases threatening the macula or optic nerve; these are generally used alongside systemic agents rather than alone.
Treatment is continued until immune reconstitution (CD4 count >100 cells/mm³ for at least 3-6 months) and resolution of active retinitis.
Management of underlying immunosuppression
Prompt initiation or optimisation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for long-term control and prevention of recurrence.
Coordination between
ophthalmology
, infectious diseases, and HIV services is required.
Immune recovery uveitis
may develop following ART initiation; this requires specialist assessment as management differs from active CMV retinitis.
Monitoring and complications
Patients require regular ophthalmological review to assess response to therapy, detect complications such as retinal detachment, and monitor for drug toxicity (notably myelosuppression with ganciclovir).
Secondary prophylaxis (maintenance antiviral therapy) should be continued until sustained immune recovery has been achieved (
NICE NG203
).
Treatment interruption risks vision loss—adherence must be emphasised.
