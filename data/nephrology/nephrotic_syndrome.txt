Complications
- Increased risk of infection due to urinary immunoglobulin loss
Increased risk of thromboembolism related to loss of antithrombin III and plasminogen in the urine. This may result in a renal vein thrombosis, resulting in a sudden deterioration in renal function
Hyperlipidaemia
Hypocalcaemia (vitamin D and binding protein lost in urine)
Acute renal failure
