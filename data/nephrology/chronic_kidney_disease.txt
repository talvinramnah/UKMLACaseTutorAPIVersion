Chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing due to the rise in risk factors such as diabetes and
hypertension
. CKD is classified into five stages based on the level of kidney function, with stage 1 being the mildest and stage 5 being the most severe. Patients with CKD are at increased risk of developing complications such as cardiovascular disease, anaemia, and bone disease. Management of CKD involves controlling underlying risk factors, such as blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and addressing complications as they arise. In advanced stages of CKD, patients may require renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis or kidney transplantation. Regular monitoring and management of CKD are essential to prevent or delay the progression of the disease and improve patient outcomes.

Clinical features
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a long-standing condition that leads to a gradual loss of kidney function over time. The symptoms of CKD often go unnoticed until the disease has significantly progressed because the kidneys can compensate for their diminished function in the early stages.
Early Clinical Manifestations
In the early stages of CKD, symptoms are often non-specific, mild, or absent. When present, they can include:
Fatigue:
This is due to the build-up of toxins that the kidneys are unable to filter out, as well as anaemia, a common feature in CKD resulting from reduced erythropoietin production by the kidneys.
Polyuria
or Nocturia:
Changes in urine output can occur. Some individuals may experience increased frequency of urination, particularly at night.
Hypertension
:
High blood pressure can be both a cause and an early consequence of CKD due to dysregulation of fluid volume and the renin-angiotensin system.
Puffiness or Swelling:
This is typically around the eyes or in the ankles and legs due to fluid retention.
Later Clinical Manifestations
As CKD progresses to more severe stages, including end-stage renal disease, the symptoms become more apparent and disruptive:
Decreased Urine Output:
Oliguria or anuria may occur in the advanced stages of CKD.
Fluid Overload Symptoms:
These can include shortness of breath due to pulmonary oedema, peripheral oedema, and hypertension.
Uraemic Symptoms:
As toxin levels rise, symptoms such as
nausea
,
vomiting
,
anorexia
, metallic taste in the mouth, hiccups, and
pruritus
can develop.
Neurological Symptoms:
These can range from difficulty concentrating and fatigue to more severe manifestations such as seizures and coma in the setting of uraemic encephalopathy.
Cardiovascular Symptoms:
Patients may experience chest pain or shortness of breath due to CKD-related cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and pericarditis.
Anaemia Symptoms:
Fatigue, pallor, and dyspnoea on exertion can occur due to anaemia.
Bone and Mineral Disease:
CKD can disrupt calcium and phosphate balance, leading to bone pain, fractures, and other symptoms of renal osteodystrophy.
Metabolic Acidosis Symptoms:
Patients may present with symptoms of metabolic acidosis, such as rapid breathing, confusion, and
lethargy
.

Investigations
Proteinuria
Proteinuria is an important marker of chronic kidney disease, especially for diabetic nephropathy. NICE recommend using the albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) in preference to the protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) when identifying patients with proteinuria as it has greater sensitivity. For quantification and monitoring of proteinuria, PCR can be used as an alternative, although ACR is recommended in diabetics. Urine reagent strips are not recommended unless they express the result as an ACR

Collecting an ACR sample
by collecting a 'spot' sample it avoids the need to collect urine over a 24 hour period in order to detect or quantify proteinuria
should be a first-pass morning urine specimen
if the initial ACR is between 3 mg/mmol and 70 mg/mmol, this should be confirmed by a subsequent early morning sample. If the initial ACR is 70 mg/mmol or more, a repeat sample need not be tested.
Interpreting the ACR results
the NICE guidelines state 'regard a confirmed ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more as clinically important proteinuria'
NICE recommendations for referral to a nephrologist:
a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) of 70 mg/mmol or more, unless known to be caused by diabetes and already appropriately treated
a urinary ACR of 30 mg/mmol or more, together with persistent haematuria (two out of three dipstick tests show 1+ or more of blood) after exclusion of a urinary tract infection
consider referral to a nephrologist for people with an ACR between 3-29 mg/mmol who have persistent haematuria and other risk factors such as a declining eGFR, or cardiovascular disease

Diagnosis
Serum creatinine may not provide an accurate estimate of renal function due to differences in muscle. For this reason formulas were develop to help estimate the glomerular filtration rate (estimated GFR or eGFR). The most commonly used formula is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, which uses the following variables:
serum creatinine
age
gender
ethnicity
Factors which may affect the result
pregnancy
muscle mass (e.g. amputees, body-builders)
eating red meat 12 hours prior to the sample being taken
CKD may be classified according to GFR:
CKD stage
GFR range
1
Greater than 90 ml/min, with some sign of kidney damage on other tests (if all the kidney tests* are normal, there is no CKD)
2
60-90 ml/min with some sign of kidney damage (if kidney tests* are normal, there is no CKD)
3a
45-59 ml/min, a moderate reduction in kidney function
3b
30-44 ml/min, a moderate reduction in kidney function
4
15-29 ml/min, a severe reduction in kidney function
5
Less than 15 ml/min, established kidney failure - dialysis or a kidney transplant may be needed
*i.e. normal U&Es and no proteinuria

Complications
Anaemia
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may develop anaemia due to a variety of factors, the most significant of which is reduced erythropoietin levels. This is usually a normochromic normocytic anaemia and becomes apparent when the GFR is less than 35 ml/min (other causes of anaemia should be considered if the GFR is > 60 ml/min). Anaemia in CKD predisposes to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy - associated with a three fold increase in mortality in renal patients
Causes of anaemia in renal failure
reduced erythropoietin levels - the most significant factor
reduced erythropoiesis due to toxic effects of uraemia on bone marrow
reduced absorption of iron
anorexia
/
nausea
due to uraemia
reduced red cell survival (especially in haemodialysis)
blood loss due to capillary fragility and poor platelet function
stress ulceration leading to chronic blood loss
Management
the 2011 NICE guidelines suggest a target haemoglobin of 10 - 12 g/dl
determination and optimisation of iron status should be carried out prior to the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). Many patients, especially those on haemodialysis, will require IV iron
ESAs such as erythropoietin and darbepoetin should be used in those 'who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function'
Mineral bone disease
The aim is to reduce phosphate and parathyroid hormone levels.
Overview
reduced dietary intake of phosphate is the first-line management
phosphate binders
vitamin D: alfacalcidol, calcitriol
parathyroidectomy may be needed in some cases
Phosphate binders
aluminium-based binders are less commonly used now
calcium-based binders
problems include hypercalcemia and vascular calcification
sevelamer
a non-calcium based binder that is now increasingly used
binds to dietary phosphate and prevents its absorption
also appears to have other beneficial effects including reducing uric acid levels and improving the lipid profiles of patients with chronic kidney disease
Hypertension
The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require more than two drugs to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors are first-line and are particularly helpful in proteinuric renal disease (e.g. diabetic nephropathy). As these drugs tend to reduce filtration pressure a small fall in glomerular filtration pressure (GFR) and rise in creatinine can be expected. NICE suggest that a decrease in eGFR of up to 25% or a rise in creatinine of up to 30% is acceptable, although any rise should prompt careful monitoring and exclusion of other causes (e.g. NSAIDs). A rise greater than this may indicate underlying renovascular disease.
Furosemide is useful as an anti-hypertensive in patients with CKD, particularly when the GFR falls to below 45 ml/min. It has the added benefit of lowering serum potassium. High doses are usually required. If the patient becomes at risk of dehydration (e.g. Gastroenteritis) then consideration should be given to temporarily stopping the drug
