Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a rare but serious condition that can lead to renal failure,
anaemia
and
thrombocytopenia
. It is most commonly caused by an infection with certain strains of
E. coli
bacteria, particularly in children under the age of five. HUS can also be caused by other infections, medications, or genetic factors.
The symptoms of HUS can include bloody
diarrhoea
,
abdominal pain
,
vomiting
, and decreased urine output.
Treatment for HUS involves supportive care, such as fluid and electrolyte management, blood transfusions, and dialysis if necessary. Antibiotics are not recommended unless there is evidence of an active bacterial infection.

Pathophysiology
Most cases are secondary (termed 'typical HUS'):
classically Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) 0157:H7 ('verotoxigenic', 'enterohaemorrhagic'). This is the most common cause in children, accounting for over 90% of cases
pneumococcal infection
HIV
rare: systemic lupus erythematosus, drugs, cancer
Primary HUS ('atypical') is due to complement dysregulation.

Clinical features
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome is generally seen in young children and produces a triad of:
acute kidney injury
microangiopathic haemolytic
anaemia
thrombocytopenia

Management
Management
treatment is supportive e.g. Fluids, blood transfusion and dialysis if required
there is no role for antibiotics, despite the preceding diarrhoeal illness in many patients
the indications for plasma exchange in HUS are complicated. As a general rule plasma exchange is reserved for severe cases of HUS not associated with
diarrhoea
eculizumab (a C5 inhibitor monoclonal antibody) has evidence of greater efficiency than plasma exchange alone in the treatment of adult atypical HUS
