Aetiology
The aetiology of MPA is largely unknown but is generally attributed to anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibodies or ANCA. However, only 70% of patients with MPA have ANCA when diagnosed, with cases of limited MPA being ANCA negative. A number of other factors have been suggested including:
Silica exposure
Silica particles stimulate T and B cells
Inhalation in susceptible individuals may trigger ANCA production
A number of case-control studies demonstrate of those patients with ANCA associated rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, 22-46% were previously exposed to silica
Silica-associated ANCA disease has been shown to demonstrate p-ANCA on direct immunofluorescence and antibodies against MPO
Geographical location and seasons
From north to south, increasing incidence of MPA seen, whereas decreasing incidence of
granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Studies from Europe, USA and China demonstrate higher incidence of vasculitis during winter months compared to summer
Infectious causes: Staph aureus, hepatitis C
May lead to the phenomenon of
molecular mimicry
and generation of ANCA
Drugs
Hydralazine, thionamides, sulfasalazine, and minocycline
have been associated with an increased incidence of AAV, including MPA
Genetics
A number of MHC class II genes are associated with MPA, with
HLA-DQ
most commonly associated
Pathogenic B cell response and production of ANCA
Loss of CD-19 expression in patients with MPA
Loss of self-tolerance, leading to the production of autoreactive B cells
Aberrant T cell response
A higher proportion of activated T cells, T activation markers, and memory cells
Dominant Th1 response in MPA

Pathophysiology
An unknown trigger induces an autoimmune response in which circulating autoantibodies, react with antigens in cytoplasm of neutrophils and monocytes. The major autoantigens in microscopic polyangiitis are
MPO
and
PR3
. The formation of these antibodies has been hypothesised to be due to the following process:
Exposure of neutrophils to inflammatory cytokinesâ→surface exposure of cryptogenic antigens e.g. MPO and PR3â→predisposing genetic and environmental factorsâ→production of MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCAâ→react and crosslink neutrophilsâ→neutrophil attachment to vessel endothelial liningâ→release of proteolytic enzymes and oxygen free radicalsâ→vasculitis
The pathological features characteristic of MPA is a
necrotising vasculitis of small vessels
and
paucity
of immune deposits in vessel walls.  Depending upon the organ involved this can demonstrate on histology:
Skin: leukocytoclastic vasculitis
Lungs: capillaritis with fibrinoid necrosis
Renal: pauci-immune, necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis
The evidence supporting this underlying mechanism demonstrates:
The majority of patients with MPA (95%) are positive for ANCA directed against MPO (70%) and PR3 (30%)
Titres of ANCA often rise preceding disease activity
In vitro studies demonstrate reactive oxygen species and lytic enzyme release from neutrophils secondary to MPO and PR3-ANCA activation
Improve
Clinical features
As a condition that can affect multiple organ systems, MPA can initially present with a myriad of different signs and symptoms. Typically the first clinical symptoms of MPA in patients are:
Constitutional symptoms
(61%): fever, weight loss, asthenia
Musculoskeletal symptoms
(31-42%): myalgia, arthralgia
Neurological symptoms
(17%): peripheral neuropathy, convulsions, cerebral haemorrhage or infarction
Cutaneous involvement (14%): palpable purpura, splinter haemorrhages, nodules, livedo reticularis, ulcers
Night sweats (11%)
Cardiac symptoms (8%): arrhythmia, heart failure, pericarditis, myocardial infarction
Headache and/or temporal arteritis (8%)
Raynaud's phenomenon (8%)
Gastrointestinal symptoms (3%): abdominal pain, diarrhoea, GI bleeding
As the condition progresses, it will typically manifest in the following organ systems:
Renal
(80-100%): proteinuria, microscopic haematuria,
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
Neurological
(37-72%)
Musculoskeletal
(40-65%)
Dermatological (30-60%)
Gastrointestinal (30-58%)
Respiratory (25-55%): haemoptysis,
pulmonary haemorrhage
, pleural effusion, oedema
Cardiovascular (3-6%)
Improve
Investigations
In the literature, most authors define MPA based upon the
2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides
definition of a:
Necrotising vasculitis with few or no immune deposits
Involving small vessels
Necrotising glomerulonephritis commonly occurs
Pulmonary capillaritis often present
However, despite this, no formal classification criteria have been validated. A proposed algorithm by Watts et al in 2007 attempting to classify ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) including MPA, was subsequently adopted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA):
Clinical features and histology compatible with small vessel vasculitis
or
Surrogate markers of renal vasculitis and positive serology for proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO)
and
No
granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(GPA) surrogate markers
Given the broad range of nonspecific symptoms, MPA patient's typically present with, first-line investigations that would be performed in primary care include:
Urinalysis and urine protein:creatinine ratio
If findings suggest renal involvement, urgent referral to
nephrology
Bloods
FBC: exclude lymphoproliferative disorders
LFT: raised LFTs could suggest systemic involvement or hepatitis
U+E's: may demonstrate renal insufficiency
CRP and ESR: may be raised in MPA
Chest x-ray
If MPA is suspected, an urgent referral is required to secondary care due to the potentially rapidly progressive nature of the condition. This would be to the most appropriate team, depending upon the organ involvement. Further investigations carried out in secondary care include:
ANA, rheumatoid factor: this may indicate a connective tissue disease
Cryoglobulins: can indicate underlying connective tissue disease, vasculitis or autoimmune aetiology
P-ANCA: MPO or PR3 specific
Biopsy: usually renal, pulmonary or skin depending on organ involvement
Improve
Differential diagnosis
A large number of conditions may mimic MPA including other AAV diagnoses. The most common that require exclusion include:
Polyarteritis nodosa
:
Similarities: mostly identical presenting signs and symptoms
Differences:
usually no lung involvement
, strong link with Hepatitis B, only involves small to medium arteries (not venules or capillaries)
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
:
Similarities: mostly identical presenting signs and symptoms
Differences:
predominantly ear, nose and throat symptoms
, granuloma formation, associated with c-ANCA
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(Churg-Strauss):
Similarities: constitutional symptoms, night sweat's, abdominal pain, neuropathy
Differences:
presence of asthma/allergic rhinitis
, eosinophilia, paranasal sinus involvement, extravascular eosinophils seen on histology
Henoch-Schonlein purpura:
Similarities: purpuric rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain, proteinuria
Differences: more common in children,
IgA deposits
Cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis:
Similarities: Mostly identical signs and symptoms
Differences: association with Hepatitis C,
cold precipitable immune complexes (IgG and IgA) on histology
Goodpasture syndrome:
Similarities: constitutional symptoms, arthralgia, proteinuria, cough, haemoptysis
Differences:
anti-GBM antibody-positive biopsy
, no cutaneous or neurological manifestations

Management
The treatment of MPA is guided by the severity of the disease, the rate of progression, and organ involvement. The goal of treatment is to prevent organ damage through the use of immunosuppressants. In 2014, The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and British Health Professionals for Rheumatology (BHPR) developed guidelines that laid out a treatment strategy for the management of AAV, including MPA. This is approached in 3 phases: induction, maintenance, and treatment of relapse.
Induction
Initial treatment provided is grouped according to patients with severe disease, non-severe disease, and refractory disease:
Severe
1st line: cyclophosphamide (CYC) with high dose steroids. Therapy is continued for 3-6 months then switched to less toxic maintenance once remission achieved
Adjunct plasma exchange in patients with severe renal failure (creatinine >500 µmol/l) or life-threatening manifestations
Non-severe
High dose steroids with either methotrexate (MTX)
or
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
Refractory
All patients should be referred to a vasculitis centre
1st line: rituximab (RTX) in patients who have already received CYC
If rituximab is unavailable: IV immunoglobulin or switch from IV to oral CYC
Maintenance
Once remission is achieved (complete absence of clinical disease activity, including vasculitic manifestations), maintenance therapy is initiated:
1st line: low dose steroids with azathioprine (AZA)
or
MTX
If patients refractory to AZA and MTX or contraindications to use: MMF or leflunomide
At least 24 months of therapy recommended
If in remission for 1 year on maintenance therapy, tapering of steroid dose can occur
Following steroid withdrawal, immunosuppression may be tapered after 6 months
Treatment of relapse
This is determined according to whether patients have a severe or non-severe relapse.
Severe
1st line: high dose steroids and RTX or CYC
Rituximab in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial found RTX was superior to CYC at 6 and 12 months, but no significant difference at 18 months.
Addition of IV methylprednisolone or plasma exchange
Increase steroid dose if patients have received 2nd dose of CYC
Non-severe
1st line: increase steroid dose and increase or change maintenance immunosuppressive therapy
Improve
Complications
The complications of MPA depend upon the particular organ system involved during the disease process:
Urological
End-stage renal failure (ESRF): occurs in 28% of patients with a mortality of ~50%
Bladder cancer: a complication of
cyclophosphamide treatment
: 5% risk after 10 years and 16% risk after 15 years.
Pulmonary
Alveolar haemorrhage: patients have a
nine-fold increased risk of mortality
and a higher risk of relapse
Pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary artery aneurysm
Panbronchiolitis
Gastrointestinal
Colonic ulceration
Bowel ischaemia
Perforation
Neurological
Cerebral haemorrhage
Meningitis
Non-haemorrhagic infarction
Cardiovascular
Cardiomyopathy
Heart failure
Cardiovascular event (MI, stroke, pulmonary embolus): long term follow up of patients in the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS) trials of WG and MPA found within 5 years of diagnosis, 14% of patients experienced a cardiovascular event
Cutaneous
Non-melanoma skin cancer
Haematological
Leukaemia
Improve
Prognosis
The outcome of MPA depends on the severity of the condition. Without treatment mortality rate is 90% after 1 year. Aggressive immunosuppressive treatment with CYC and steroids has demonstrated patient survival at 1 and 5 years of 82% and 76% respectively. Relapses occur in around 35% of patients.
The main predictors of poor outcome associated with MPA are:
Advanced renal failure
Predictors for ESRF: serum creatinine at presentation, African American race and arterial sclerosis on renal biopsy
Older age
Higher disease activity
High WBC and low haemoglobin
The major factors involved in deaths occurring during the 1st year include:
Insufficient treatment response
Infection
After the first year, major causes of death are:
Cardiovascular disease
Malignancy
Infection
