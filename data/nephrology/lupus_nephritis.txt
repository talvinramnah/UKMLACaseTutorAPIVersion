Lupus nephritis
Lupus nephritis
Lupus nephritis is a severe manifestation of
systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) that can result in end-stage renal disease. SLE patients should be monitored by performing urinalysis at regular check-up appointments to rule out proteinuria.

Classification
WHO classification
class I: normal kidney
class II: mesangial glomerulonephritis
class III: focal (and segmental) proliferative glomerulonephritis
class IV: diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis
class V: diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis
class VI: sclerosing glomerulonephritis
Class IV (diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis) is the most common and severe form. Renal biopsy characteristically shows the following findings:
glomeruli shows endothelial and mesangial proliferation, 'wire-loop' appearance
if severe, the capillary wall may be thickened secondary to immune complex deposition
electron microscopy shows subendothelial immune complex deposits
granular appearance on immunofluorescence

Clinical features
Urinary Abnormalities
The most common clinical feature of lupus nephritis is proteinuria, which can be detected through routine urinalysis or spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Patients may also present with hematuria, pyuria, or red blood cell casts in their urine sediment.
Renal Dysfunction
Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is another important indicator of lupus nephritis. Patients may exhibit elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced estimated GFR (eGFR). In advanced cases, patients can develop acute kidney injury or progress to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation.
Hypertension
Renal involvement in
SLE
often leads to increased blood pressure due to impaired renal autoregulation and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Hypertension can exacerbate renal damage and contribute to cardiovascular complications in these patients.
Oedema
Nephrotic-range proteinuria (>3.5 g/day) can lead to hypoalbuminemia, causing fluid retention and subsequent peripheral oedema in patients with lupus nephritis.
