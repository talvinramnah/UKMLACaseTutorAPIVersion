Lyme disease
Lyme disease
Lyme disease is a multisystemic, tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete bacterium
Borrelia burgdorferi
, transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of infected
Ixodes
ticks. The disease is prevalent in North America, Europe, and Asia, with the highest incidence in heavily wooded and grassy areas. Lyme disease manifests in three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late disseminated.
Early localized infection is characterized by erythema migrans, a bull's-eye rash, accompanied by flu-like symptoms such as
fever
,
malaise
, and joint aches. If left untreated, the infection can disseminate, leading to neurological, cardiac, and musculoskeletal involvement. Manifestations include
facial nerve palsy
, meningitis, carditis with heart block, and migratory
joint pain
. Late disseminated disease can present as chronic arthritis, encephalopathy, or peripheral neuropathy.
Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical presentation, epidemiological context, and serological testing. Treatment involves antibiotics, with
doxycycline
or amoxicillin as first-line agents for most patients, and ceftriaxone for severe cases or those with neurological involvement. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Primary prevention strategies include tick avoidance, prompt removal of attached ticks, and prophylactic antibiotic treatment in high-risk cases.

Aetiology
Causative agent
Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete bacterium
Borrelia burgdorferi
, with closely related species
Borrelia afzelii
and
Borrelia garinii
causing disease in Europe and Asia. These bacteria possess a unique double-membrane structure and a corkscrew-like motility, which enables them to penetrate various tissues and evade the host immune response.
Vector
Lyme disease is transmitted primarily through the bite of infected
Ixodes
ticks, including
Ixodes scapularis
(black-legged tick) in the United States and
Ixodes ricinus
(castor bean tick) in Europe. The risk of transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment, with the highest risk occurring after 36-48 hours.

Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of Lyme disease involves a complex interplay between the
Borrelia
spirochetes and the host immune response, resulting in varied clinical manifestations.
Inoculation and Localized Infection
Following a tick bite,
Borrelia
spirochetes are inoculated into the skin, where they multiply and begin to disseminate. The host immune response and tissue tropism of the spirochetes contribute to the development of erythema migrans, the characteristic bull's-eye rash that develops in approximately 70-80% of infected individuals.
Dissemination
As the infection progresses,
Borrelia
spirochetes can disseminate through the bloodstream and lymphatics, invading various tissues such as the joints, heart, and nervous system. This widespread dissemination results in the early disseminated stage of Lyme disease, characterized by neurological, cardiac, and musculoskeletal manifestations, including
facial nerve palsy
, meningitis, carditis with heart block, and migratory
joint pain
.
Host Immune Response
The host immune response plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. While the immune response can initially help control the infection, it may also contribute to tissue damage and inflammation, leading to the late disseminated stage of Lyme disease. This stage can present as chronic arthritis, encephalopathy, or peripheral neuropathy.
Immune Evasion
Borrelia
spirochetes have developed several immune evasion strategies, including antigenic variation, the ability to suppress host immune responses, and the formation of biofilms. These mechanisms enable the bacteria to persist in the host and contribute to the chronic manifestations of Lyme disease.

Clinical features
Early features (within 30 days)
erythema migrans
'bulls-eye' rash is typically at the site of the tick bite
typically develops 1-4 weeks after the initial bite but may present sooner
usually painless, more than 5 cm in diameter and slowlly increases in size
present in around 80% of patients
.
systemic features
headache
lethargy
fever
arthralgia
Later features (after 30 days)
cardiovascular
heart block
peri/
myocarditis
neurological
facial nerve palsy
radicular pain
meningitis

Investigations
Investigation
NICE recommend that
Lyme disease can be diagnosed clinically if erythema migrans is present
erythema migrans is therefore an indication to start antibiotics
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) antibodies to
Borrelia burgdorferi
are the first-line test
if negative and Lyme disease is still suspected in people tested within 4 weeks from symptom onset,
repeat the ELISA 4-6 weeks
after the first ELISA test. If still suspected in people who have had symptoms for 12 weeks or more then an immunoblot test should be done
if positive or equivocal then an immunoblot test for Lyme disease should be done
Improve
Differential diagnosis
Mononucleosis (Glandular
Fever
):
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
is the primary causative agent in Mononucleosis, unlike Lyme disease which is caused by the spirochete bacterium
Borrelia burgdorferi
.
Both diseases may present with
fatigue
, headache, and lymphadenopathy. However, a sore throat and splenomegaly are more commonly associated with Mononucleosis.
A heterophile antibody test (Monospot) can help confirm a diagnosis of Mononucleosis while serological tests are used for diagnosing Lyme disease.

Management
Management of
asymptomatic tick bites
tick bites can be a relatively common presentation to GP practices, and can cause significant anxiety
if the tick is still present, the best way to
remove it is using fine-tipped tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the skin as possible and pulling upwards firmly
. The area should be washed following.
NICE guidance does not recommend routine antibiotic treatment to patients who've suffered a tick bite
Management of suspected/confirmed Lyme disease
doxycycline
if early disease.
Amoxicillin is an alternative if doxycycline is contraindicated (e.g. pregnancy)
people with erythema migrans should be commenced on antibiotic without the need for further tests
ceftriaxone
if disseminated disease
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is sometimes seen after initiating therapy:
fever
, rash, tachycardia after first dose of antibiotic (more commonly seen in syphilis, another spirochaetal disease)

Complications
Neurological Complications
Borrelia burgdorferi
, the causative agent of Lyme disease, can infiltrate the central nervous system leading to neuroborreliosis. This may manifest as lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis (particularly
facial nerve palsy
), and radiculoneuritis.
Encephalomyelitis, a rare complication, is characterised by focal abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord.
Late-stage neurological complications include Lyme encephalopathy and chronic axonal polyneuropathy.
Cardiac Complications
Lyme carditis occurs when
Borrelia burgdorferi
infects the heart tissue. The most common manifestation is fluctuating degrees of atrioventricular block. Other presentations include myopericarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy.
Musculoskeletal Complications
The most common musculoskeletal manifestations are intermittent attacks of oligoarticular arthritis that primarily affect the knee joint. Chronic Lyme arthritis, a late disease manifestation, can develop into erosive arthritis if untreated.
Ocular Complications
Lyme disease can cause several ocular complications including conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, retinal vasculitis, optic neuritis and choroiditis.
Dermatological Complications
Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is a late dermatological manifestation of Lyme disease. It is characterised by progressive skin fibrosis and atrophy, predominantly on the extensor surfaces of extremities.
Psychiatric Complications
Untreated Lyme disease may lead to psychiatric complications over time. These include cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, sleep disorders, and
fatigue
