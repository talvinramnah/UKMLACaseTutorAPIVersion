HIV
HIV
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a retrovirus that targets CD4+ T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, leading to progressive immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies. HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, and mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.
There are two main types of HIV: HIV-1, which is more prevalent and aggressive, and HIV-2, which is less pathogenic and primarily found in West Africa. The virus undergoes rapid mutation and recombination, leading to a high degree of genetic diversity and the emergence of drug-resistant strains.
Diagnosis is based on detecting HIV-specific antibodies or viral RNA. HIV-infected patients are monitored for disease progression using CD4+ T-cell counts and viral load measurements.
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the mainstay of treatment, which aims to suppress viral replication, restore immune function, and prevent complications. ART regimens typically consist of a combination of at least three drugs from different classes, such as nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), and entry/fusion inhibitors.
Strict adherence to ART is crucial to achieve and maintain viral suppression, minimize drug resistance, and reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality

Aetiology
The aetiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection encompasses a variety of risk factors and underlying causes. The primary mode of transmission is through sexual contact, with the highest risk associated with unprotected receptive anal intercourse. However, HIV can also be transmitted through other routes, including:
Parenteral transmission:
This includes sharing needles or syringes among people who inject drugs. It can also occur in healthcare settings due to accidental needlestick injuries.
Vertical transmission:
HIV can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
Blood transfusion:
Although rare in countries where blood is screened for HIV antibodies, this route of transmission remains a risk factor in areas where screening is not routine.
In addition to these modes of transmission, certain biological factors increase the likelihood of acquiring HIV. These include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can cause sores or inflammatory responses that make it easier for HIV to enter the body. Circumcision status also influences risk; uncircumcised men have a higher probability of contracting HIV than circumcised men due to the presence of Langerhans cells in the foreskin which are susceptible to HIV infection.
Social and behavioural determinants play a significant role in the spread of HIV as well. High-risk behaviours such as unprotected sex with multiple partners and intravenous drug use increase an individual's chances of exposure to the virus. Socioeconomic factors such as poverty, lack of education and gender inequality can limit access to prevention services and contribute to increased vulnerability.
The genetic makeup of both
HIV
and its host can affect susceptibility to infection and disease progression. Certain alleles like CCR5-Δ32 provide resistance against HIV by preventing viral entry into the host cell. Conversely, individuals with HLA-B*35 allele may experience rapid disease progression.
Finally, co-infections can impact the course of HIV infection. For example, co-infection with
Hepatitis C virus
(HCV) can accelerate liver disease progression in people living with HIV.

Pathophysiology
Basics
HIV is a RNA retrovirus of the lentivirus genus (lentiviruses are characterized by a long incubation period)
two variants - HIV-1 and HIV-2
HIV-2 is more common in west Africa, has a lower transmission rate and is thought to be less pathogenic with a slower progression to AIDS
Basics structure
spherical in shape with two copies of single-stranded RNA enclosed by a capsid of the viral protein p24
a matrix composed of viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid
envelope proteins: gp120 and gp41
pol gene encodes for viral enzymes reverse transcriptase, integrase and HIV protease
Cell entry
HIV can infect CD4 T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells
gp120 binds to CD4 and CXCR4 on T cells and CD4 and CCR5 on macrophages
mutations in CCR5 can give immunity to HIV
Replication
after entering a cell the enzyme reverse transcriptase creates dsDNA from the RNA for integration into the host cell's genome
Improve
Clinical features
HIV seroconversion
HIV seroconversion is symptomatic in 60-80% of patients and typically presents as a glandular fever type illness. Increased symptomatic severity is associated with poorer long term prognosis. It typically occurs 3-12 weeks after infection
Features

lymphadenopathy
malaise

Diagnosis
antibodies to HIV may not be present
HIV PCR and p24 antigen tests can confirm diagnosis

Investigations
Investigating a patient with suspected HIV infection involves a sequence of tests, starting with first-line investigations and progressing to more specific diagnostic tests if necessary. The goal is to confirm the diagnosis, assess the stage of disease, and evaluate the patient's overall health status.
First-line Investigations
HIV Antibody/Antigen Test:
This is the initial screening test for HIV. It detects both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies as well as p24 antigen, a protein produced by the virus in early infection. A positive result warrants further testing to confirm the diagnosis.
HIV RNA Viral Load:
This test measures the amount of virus in blood. It is particularly useful in cases where acute HIV infection is suspected and antibody/antigen test may be negative.
Further Investigations
If initial screening tests are positive, additional investigations are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess disease progression.
HIV Confirmatory Test:
Western blot or immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were traditionally used for this purpose; however, these have largely been replaced by an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay which can determine whether the patient has been infected with HIV-1, HIV-2 or both.
CD4 T-cell Count:
This test measures the number of CD4 cells in blood, providing an indication of immune system function. A low count suggests advanced disease and helps guide treatment decisions.
Resistance Testing:
Genotypic resistance testing should be performed prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) to identify any drug-resistant strains of HIV that could affect treatment efficacy.
In addition to these HIV-specific investigations, it is important to perform a comprehensive health assessment. This includes full blood count, liver and renal function tests, lipid profile, glucose level, hepatitis B and C serology, tuberculosis screening, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) screening and immunisation status review. These investigations help evaluate the patient's overall health status, identify any comorbid conditions and guide management plan.
The British HIV Association (BHIVA) provides comprehensive guidelines on HIV testing, which should be referred to for up-to-date information on recommended testing protocols.

Management
Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) involves a combination of at least three drugs, typically two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and either a  protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). This combination both decreases viral replication but also reduces the risk of viral resistance emerging
Following the 2015 BHIVA guidelines it is now recommended that patients start HAART as soon as they have been diagnosed with HIV, rather than waiting until a particular CD4 count, as was previously advocated.
Entry inhibitors
maraviroc (binds to CCR5, preventing an interaction with gp41), enfuvirtide (binds to gp41, also known as a 'fusion inhibitor')
prevent HIV-1 from entering and infecting immune cells
Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)
examples: zidovudine (AZT), abacavir, emtricitabine, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, tenofovir
general NRTI side-effects: peripheral neuropathy
tenofovir: used in BHIVAs two recommended regime NRTI. Adverse effects include renal impairment and ostesoporosis
zidovudine: anaemia, myopathy, black nails
didanosine: pancreatitis
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)
examples: nevirapine, efavirenz
side-effects: P450 enzyme interaction (nevirapine induces), rashes
Protease inhibitors (PI)
examples: indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir
side-effects: diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, buffalo hump, central obesity, P450 enzyme inhibition
indinavir: renal stones, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinaemia
ritonavir: a potent inhibitor of the P450 system
Integrase inhibitors
examples:  raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir
