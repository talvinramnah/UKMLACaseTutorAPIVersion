Staphylococcal enteritis
Staphylococcal enteritis
Staphylococcal enteritis is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused by the ingestion of preformed enterotoxins produced by
Staphylococcus aureus
. These heat-stable toxins are capable of withstanding boiling temperatures and are responsible for causing a wide range of symptoms in affected individuals.

Clinical features
The onset of staphylococcal enteritis is typically abrupt, occurring within 1 to 6 hours after ingestion of contaminated food. The rapid onset can be attributed to the direct action of preformed enterotoxins on the gastrointestinal tract, without requiring bacterial colonization or multiplication. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours; however, severe cases may persist for a longer duration.
Gastrointestinal Manifestations:
Nausea and Vomiting:
These are the predominant symptoms experienced by patients with staphylococcal enteritis, often appearing suddenly and persisting throughout the course of illness.
Abdominal Pain:
Patients may experience abdominal cramping or pain due to increased intestinal motility and inflammation caused by the enterotoxins.
Diarrhoea:
Watery diarrhoea may develop within hours after symptom onset but is generally less prominent than nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea usually subsides as the illness progresses.
Anorexia:
Loss of appetite is common during episodes of staphylococcal enteritis due to ongoing nausea and gastrointestinal discomfort.
Systemic Manifestations:
Fever:
A low-grade fever may be present in some patients with staphylococcal enteritis, but high-grade fevers are uncommon.
Malaise:
Generalized weakness, fatigue, and malaise are frequently reported by patients with staphylococcal enteritis.
Dehydration:
Severe vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to dehydration, particularly in young children, elderly individuals, and those with compromised immune systems. Clinical signs of dehydration include tachycardia, hypotension, dry mucous membranes, and decreased urine output.
Though rare, extraintestinal manifestations of staphylococcal enteritis have been reported in the literature. These include:
Reactive Arthritis:
Joint pain and inflammation may occur within days to weeks after an episode of staphylococcal enteritis.
Erythema Nodosum:
This inflammatory skin condition is characterized by tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities and has been associated with staphylococcal enteritis.
Glomerulonephritis:
Acute glomerulonephritis can develop as a rare complication of staphylococcal enteritis, presenting with hematuria, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction.
