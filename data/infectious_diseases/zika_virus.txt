Pathophysiology
Transmission is usually via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, although a small number of cases of sexual transmission have been reported. There is increasing evidence of transmission via the placenta from mother to fetus.

Clinical features
The majority of people infected with Zika virus have no symptoms. For those with symptoms, Zika virus tends to cause a mild, short-lived (2 to 7 days) febrile disease. Signs and symptoms suggestive of Zika virus infection may include a combination of the following:
fever
rash
arthralgia/arthritis
conjunctivitis
myalgia
headache
retro-orbital pain
pruritus

Complications
Serious complications in adults are not common, although the virus has been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Scientific consensus however has linked Zika with microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities, which has led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Advice for travellers
There is currently no vaccine or drug to prevent Zika infection. Prevention revolves around avoiding mosquito bites (Aedes mosquitoes usually bite during the day) by using mosquito repellent and cover-up clothing. Pregnant women are advised to avoid non-essential travel to Zika prevalent areas until after pregnancy.
