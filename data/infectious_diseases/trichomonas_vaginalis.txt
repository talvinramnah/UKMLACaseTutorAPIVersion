Aetiology
Trichomonas vaginalis
is a flagellated, anaerobic, protozoan parasite. It is the causative agent of trichomoniasis, one of the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide, affecting both males and females.
Transmission
The primary route of transmission of
Trichomonas vaginalis
is through sexual contact, with the parasite primarily infecting the squamous epithelium of the urogenital tract. The organism can persist on inanimate objects such as towels and toilet seats for a short period, however, the significance of these routes in transmission is unclear.
Improve
Pathophysiology
After transmission, the trophozoites (the active, motile stage of the parasite) adhere to the squamous epithelial cells of the urogenital tract, aided by adhesins on their surface. They can evade the host's immune response through several mechanisms, including antigenic variation and interference with host immune factors.
Immunity
Both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses occur following
T. vaginalis
infection, but they are generally ineffective in clearing the infection due to the parasite's immune evasion strategies. Reinfection is common, suggesting that protective immunity is not typically acquired.
Improve
Clinical features
A stereotypical presentation of
Trichomonas vaginalis
infection in women is with a profuse, offensive, frothy yellow-green
vaginal discharge
accompanied by vulval irritation or itching.
Dysuria
and dyspareunia are also frequently reported. In men, infection is often asymptomatic but may present with urethral discharge or dysuria.
Women
Many cases are asymptomatic; when symptoms occur, they typically include:
Vaginal discharge: classically described as thin, frothy, yellow-green and malodorous
Vulval pruritus and irritation
Dysuria (external)
Dyspareunia
On examination:
Erythema of the vulva and vaginal mucosa
‘Strawberry cervix’ (punctate cervical haemorrhages), seen in a minority but considered characteristic
Men
Most infections are asymptomatic
When symptomatic:
Urethral discharge (usually mild)
Dysuria
Occasionally balanitis or prostatitis
Other features
Infection may persist for months if untreated due to limited host immune response
Complications
can include increased risk of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV acquisition and transmission (
NICE CKS: Trichomoniasis
)
In pregnancy, trichomoniasis has been associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm birth
The majority of infected individuals—especially men—are asymptomatic.
However, the presence of persistent genitourinary symptoms should prompt consideration of trichomoniasis alongside other causes.

Investigations
Diagnosis of
Trichomonas vaginalis
infection requires laboratory confirmation, as symptoms alone are insufficient for definitive diagnosis and may overlap with other sexually transmitted infections
Microscopy of
vaginal discharge
has traditionally been the first-line investigation but has limited sensitivity
More sensitive molecular and point-of-care tests are now available and recommended
Microscopy
Wet mount microscopy of vaginal discharge can be performed in clinic settings
Sample is mixed with saline and examined under the microscope for motile trichomonads
Sensitivity is poor (45-60%) even in experienced hands
Specificity is high (>95%) when motile organisms are visualised
Sensitivity decreases if there is any delay in sample processing as organisms lose motility
BASHH guidelines
note that microscopy alone is insufficient to rule out infection
Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)
NAATs are now the gold standard for diagnosis with sensitivity >95%
Can be performed on vaginal swabs, endocervical swabs, or first-void urine samples
Many laboratories now include
T. vaginalis
testing as part of combined STI screening panels
BASHH guidelines
recommend NAATs as the preferred diagnostic method where available
Point-of-Care Tests
Rapid antigen detection tests are available for use in clinic settings
OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test has sensitivity of 82-95% compared to NAATs
Results available within 10-15 minutes
Particularly useful in settings where microscopy expertise is limited or NAAT testing is not readily available
Additional investigations should include screening for other STIs
All patients diagnosed with
T. vaginalis
should be offered full STI screening
Co-infection with other STIs is common
Testing for HIV should be recommended as
T. vaginalis
infection is associated with increased HIV transmission
In men, diagnosis is more challenging as microscopy of urethral samples has very poor sensitivity
NAATs on first-void urine samples are preferred
Culture of urethral swabs or urine sediment is an alternative but less sensitive than NAATs

Differential diagnosis
Comparison of
bacterial vaginosis
and
Trichomonas vaginalis
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)
Both conditions present with
vaginal discharge
and raised vaginal pH (>4.5)
BV discharge is typically thin, homogeneous, grey-white with a characteristic 'fishy' odour, particularly noticeable after sexual intercourse
Unlike
T. vaginalis
, BV does not cause significant inflammation or pruritus
Microscopy in BV shows 'clue cells' (epithelial cells covered with bacteria) rather than motile trophozoites
BV lacks the strawberry cervix appearance sometimes seen with trichomoniasis
Vulvovaginal
Candidiasis
Presents with vaginal discharge and vulvovaginal symptoms
Candidal discharge is typically thick, white, and 'cottage cheese-like' in appearance
Vaginal pH remains normal (3.8-4.5) in candidiasis, unlike the raised pH in trichomoniasis
Pruritus is typically more severe in candidiasis
Microscopy shows pseudohyphae and/or yeast cells rather than motile trophozoites
Erythema and oedema of the vulva and vagina are common, but strawberry cervix is absent
Chlamydial Cervicitis
May present with vaginal discharge, though often asymptomatic in women
Chlamydial discharge is typically mucopurulent rather than frothy
Chlamydia more commonly causes post-coital or intermenstrual bleeding
Lacks the characteristic offensive odour of trichomoniasis
Diagnosis requires specific nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) rather than microscopy
Often co-exists with
T. vaginalis
, as noted in
BASHH guidelines
, so consider testing for both infections

Management
Aims of Treatment
The primary aims of treating
Trichomonas vaginalis
infection are to:
Eradicate the infection
Relieve symptoms
Prevent transmission to sexual partners
Reduce risk of complications, including increased susceptibility to HIV acquisition
Antimicrobial Therapy
First-line treatment is oral metronidazole
as recommended by the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH)
Single-dose regimen or multi-day course may be prescribed
Treatment should be given to both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals
Metronidazole is effective in approximately 90-95% of cases
Alternative treatments for patients with metronidazole allergy or treatment failure:
Tinidazole (another nitroimidazole with similar efficacy)
Clotrimazole intravaginally (less effective but may provide symptomatic relief)
Treatment during pregnancy:
Metronidazole is considered safe in all trimesters
Pregnant women should be treated to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes
NICE guidelines recommend that symptomatic pregnant women should be treated, while asymptomatic women may be treated after the first trimester
Partner Management
All sexual partners within the previous 4 weeks should be notified and treated
Partners should be treated regardless of their test results
Abstinence from sexual intercourse is recommended until both partners have completed treatment
Partner notification should be conducted sensitively and confidentially
Expedited partner therapy may be considered where permitted
Treatment Failure
In cases of treatment failure:
Confirm adherence to original treatment regimen
Consider reinfection from untreated partner
Test for metronidazole resistance (available in specialist centres)
Management of resistant cases:
Higher dose metronidazole regimens
Extended course of tinidazole
Referral to specialist services may be required for persistent infection
Follow-up testing is not routinely recommended if symptoms resolve
Consider test of cure in pregnant women or if symptoms persist
