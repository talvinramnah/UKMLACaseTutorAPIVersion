Malaria (Falciparum)
Malaria (Falciparum)
Malaria
(Falciparum) is a life-threatening parasitic infection caused by the
Plasmodium falciparum
species, transmitted via the
Anopheles
mosquito vector. It represents the most severe form of malaria, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
The pathogenesis involves erythrocyte invasion by merozoites, leading to intraerythrocytic replication and subsequent haemolysis. This process results in clinical manifestations such as
fever
, chills,
headache
,
myalgia
, and
malaise
. Severe complications include cerebral malaria, acute kidney injury (AKI), severe
anaemia
, respiratory distress due to pulmonary oedema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Diagnosis relies on microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears to detect intraerythrocytic parasites. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting P. falciparum-specific antigens are also available but may have limited sensitivity.
Management entails prompt initiation of antimalarial therapy with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), such as artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine. In severe cases or treatment failure with oral ACTs, parenteral artesunate is recommended. Adjunctive measures encompass supportive care including fluid management, antipyretics, analgesics, and transfusions when indicated.

Pathophysiology
Key points
following inoculation parasites (termed sporozoites) pass to the liver
in the liver they divide asexually over around 10 days, maturing into schizonts, following which they emerge from the liver (as merozoites) and infect red blood cells, appearing as tiny rings
as the parasites mature the infected red blood cells are sequestered by various tissues of the body
Plasmodium
vivax
and
Plasmodium
ovale
(but not
Plasmodium
falciparum
) lay down hypnozoites in the liver
these dormant forms are not affected by conventional antimalarial drugs and can hence reactivate after months or years

Although there is no hypnozoite stage in Falciparum, resurgences may occur due to asexual parasites resistant to quinine. Falciparum may be resistant to pyrimethamine + sulfadoxine (Fansidar) therefore doxycycline is often given

Clinical features
The incubation period for
P. falciparum
malaria
typically ranges from 7 to 30 days but may be prolonged in individuals with partial immunity or those taking antimalarial prophylaxis. The onset of symptoms can be abrupt or gradual and often presents as an undifferentiated febrile illness.
Fever
:
High-grade fever with chills and rigors is a cardinal feature of
P. falciparum
infection. The fever pattern may initially be irregular but can evolve into a more regular periodicity every 48 hours as parasitemia increases.
Headache
:
A prominent frontal headache is frequently reported by patients suffering from
P. falciparum
malaria.
Gastrointestinal symptoms:
Anorexia
, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea are common gastrointestinal manifestations that may contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
Fatigue
and
myalgia
:
Generalized weakness and muscle pain are frequent complaints associated with
P. falciparum
infection.
Splenomegaly
and
hepatomegaly
:
Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) is almost universally present in acute malaria infections, while hepatomegaly may also occur due to hepatic dysfunction or congestion from hemolysis.
P. falciparum
malaria can progress rapidly to severe disease and death if not promptly diagnosed and treated. The following complications are characteristic of severe
P. falciparum
infection:
Cerebral malaria:
Characterized by altered consciousness, ranging from
confusion
to deep coma, seizures, and neurological deficits. This is a medical emergency that requires urgent intervention.
Severe
anaemia
:
Haemolysis, dyserythropoiesis, and splenic sequestration contribute to the development of severe anaemia in
P. falciparum
malaria.
Acute kidney injury (AKI):
This may result from acute tubular necrosis due to hemoglobinuria, hypovolemia, or sepsis.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS):
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema can occur as a complication of
P. falciparum
infection, leading to ARDS and respiratory failure.
Hypoglycemia:
Both increased glucose consumption by parasites and impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis can lead to life-threatening hypoglycemia in patients with
P. falciparum
malaria.
Coagulopathy:
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may develop secondary to endothelial activation by parasitized erythrocytes or as a result of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS):
Severe
P. falciparum
infection can cause multiple organ systems to fail, including cardiovascular collapse and shock.

Investigations
The gold standard for diagnosis of
malaria
remains the blood film. Rapid diagnostic tests (detecting plasmodial histidine-rich protein 2) are currently being trialled and have shown sensitivities from 77-99% and specificities from 83-98% for falciparum malaria
Blood film - if doubt about diagnosis should be repeated
thick: more sensitive
thin: determine species
Other tests
thrombocythaemia is characteristic
normochromic normocytic
anaemia
normal white cell count
reticulocytosis

Management
Uncomplicated falciparum
malaria
strains resistant to chloroquine are prevalent in certain areas of Asia and Africa
the 2010 WHO guidelines recommend artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as first-line therapy
examples include artemether plus lumefantrine, artesunate plus amodiaquine, artesunate plus mefloquine, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine
Feature of severe malaria
schizonts on a blood film
parasitaemia > 2%
hypoglycaemia
acidosis

severe
anaemia
complications as below
Severe falciparum malaria
a parasite counts of more than 2% will usually need parenteral treatment irrespective of clinical state
intravenous artesunate is now recommended by WHO in preference to intravenous quinine
if parasite count > 10% then exchange transfusion should be considered
shock may indicate coexistent bacterial septicaemia - malaria rarely causes haemodynamic collapse
