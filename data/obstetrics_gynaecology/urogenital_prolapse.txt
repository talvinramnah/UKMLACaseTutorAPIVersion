Urogenital prolapse
Urogenital prolapse
Urogenital prolapse refers to the descent of one or multiple pelvic organs (bladder, urethra, uterus, vagina, small bowel, rectum) due to a weakening in the supporting structures. It is categorised into anterior (cystocele), posterior (rectocele or enterocele) and apical (uterine or vault prolapse). The prevalence increases with age and multiparity. Risk factors include obesity, chronic coughing,
constipation
and heavy lifting.
The presentation varies from asymptomatic to symptoms affecting quality of life. Commonly reported symptoms include a sensation of a vaginal lump,
urinary symptoms
(stress incontinence, voiding dysfunction), defecatory dysfunction and sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis is predominantly clinical based on history and physical examination.
Management options range from conservative measures such as lifestyle modifications and pelvic floor muscle training to surgical interventions like native tissue repair or mesh augmentation. The choice depends on the severity of symptoms, patient's preference and medical fitness for surgery.

Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of urogenital prolapse involves a complex interplay between anatomical, physiological, and immunological factors. The process is multifactorial and can be understood in terms of changes to the pelvic floor structures and their supportive mechanisms.
Pelvic Floor Support Mechanisms
The pelvic floor comprises a network of muscles, ligaments, and fasciae that work together to provide support for the pelvic organs. Key components include the levator ani muscle group (pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, puborectalis) and connective tissues such as the endopelvic fascia.
These structures form a 'hammock' that supports the bladder, uterus, and rectum against gravity and intra-abdominal pressure. Any dysfunction or damage to these structures can compromise this support mechanism leading to urogenital prolapse.
Dysfunction or Damage to Pelvic Structures
Damage or weakening of the levator ani muscles can occur due to direct trauma (e.g., childbirth), neuromuscular damage (e.g., peripheral neuropathy), or age-related atrophy. This results in decreased muscular tone and strength compromising the supportive function of these muscles.
In addition to muscular changes, alterations in connective tissue integrity also play a significant role. Degradation or stretching of collagenous fibres within endopelvic fascia weakens its supportive capacity leading to organ descent.
Furthermore, vascular insufficiency may contribute by causing tissue ischemia leading to muscle weakness and connective tissue degradation.
Clinical Manifestations
The clinical manifestations of urogenital prolapse are directly related to the descent of pelvic organs into the vaginal canal. This can lead to symptoms such as a sensation of a
vaginal bulge
, pelvic pressure or discomfort, lower back pain, and difficulties with sexual intercourse.
Depending on which organ is descending, other symptoms may also be present. For example, bladder prolapse (cystocele) can cause urinary incontinence or incomplete bladder emptying, while rectal prolapse (rectocele) can result in
constipation
or difficulty with defecation.
Urogenital prolapse can also lead to mucosal changes due to exposure and friction. This includes erythema, ulceration, and increased susceptibility to infection.
Hormonal Influence
Estrogen plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of pelvic structures by promoting collagen synthesis and muscular tone. Postmenopausal women with reduced estrogen levels are therefore more susceptible to urogenital prolapse due to weakened pelvic support mechanisms.

Clinical features
Urogenital prolapse refers to the descent or herniation of pelvic organs, including the uterus, bladder, urethra, rectum, and vaginal vault through the vagina due to weakening or disruption of the normal pelvic floor support structures.
Pelvic organ prolapse can be classified according to the affected compartment:
Anterior compartment: cystocele (bladder herniation) and urethrocele (urethral herniation)
Middle compartment: uterine prolapse (uterus descent) and vaginal vault prolapse (post-hysterectomy)
Posterior compartment: rectocele (rectal herniation) and enterocele (small bowel herniation)
Patients with urogenital prolapse may present with a range of symptoms depending on the severity and compartments involved:
Pelvic Pressure and Discomfort
Patients often report a sensation of heaviness or dragging in the pelvis, 'bearing-down'
Pain may worsen throughout the day as prolonged standing or physical activity exacerbates pelvic pressure.
Lower back pain may also be present.
Vaginal Bulging or Mass
Visible bulging at the introitus in advanced cases.
In less severe cases, patients may describe a feeling of something 'coming out' during straining or physical activity.
Urinary Symptoms
Stress urinary incontinence due to urethral hypermobility from anterior compartment involvement.
Urgency or frequency due to bladder outlet obstruction from cystocele or urethrocele.
Urinary retention or incomplete emptying due to a kinked or obstructed urethra.
Defecatory Dysfunction
Constipation
, straining, and incomplete evacuation due to rectocele formation in the posterior compartment.
Splinting, or the need for manual support of the vaginal wall during defecation, may be required.
Sexual Dysfunction
Dyspareunia and decreased sexual satisfaction due to discomfort from prolapse.
Physical Examination Findings
Pelvic examination should be performed with the patient in lithotomy position and during Valsalva manoeuvre.
Identification of involved compartments and assessment of descent severity using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system.
Bimanual examination to evaluate for pelvic masses, tenderness, or cervical motion tenderness.

Investigations
Investigation of urogenital prolapse involves a systematic approach, starting with first-line investigations and moving to further investigations as necessary.
First-Line Investigations
Pelvic Floor Muscle Assessment:
This is an essential part of the evaluation process. It includes assessing the strength, endurance, and coordination of the pelvic floor muscles. A weak or poorly coordinated pelvic floor can contribute to urogenital prolapse.
Urine Analysis:
A standard urine dipstick test is used to rule out urinary tract infection (UTI), which can sometimes present with similar symptoms to urogenital prolapse.
Bladder Diary:
Patients are asked to keep a record of their fluid intake and urinary output over 24-72 hours. This can help identify patterns that may suggest underlying bladder dysfunction.
Further Investigations
If initial investigations do not provide a clear diagnosis or if more information about the extent and severity of the prolapse is needed, further investigations may be required.
Cystoscopy:
This procedure allows visualisation of the interior of the bladder using a cystoscope. It helps in identifying any bladder abnormalities that might be contributing to urogenital prolapse.
Multichannel Urodynamic Studies (MUDS):
These tests assess how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra are storing and releasing urine. MUDS can provide valuable information about bladder function and capacity, detrusor activity, and voiding pressures.
Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) System:
This is a standardised system for measuring and describing the degree of pelvic organ prolapse. It provides objective and reproducible measurements of the extent of the prolapse.
While imaging modalities such as ultrasound or MRI can provide additional information, they are not typically used in the initial investigation of urogenital prolapse due to their cost and lack of superiority over clinical assessment. The diagnosis is primarily a clinical one based on symptoms, physical examination findings, and results from the investigations outlined above.

Management
Management of urogenital prolapse involves a multi-faceted approach, with decisions on treatment tailored to the individual patient's symptoms, age, general health and personal preference. The initial management often includes conservative measures:
Physiotherapy:
Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is recommended as first-line treatment for women with stage I-II prolapse.
Pessary use:
Vaginal pessaries can be used as an alternative or adjunct to PFMT in women who prefer non-surgical options or are unfit for surgery.
If conservative management fails or is not suitable, surgical intervention may be considered. Surgical options include:
Anterior colporrhaphy: Recommended for anterior compartment prolapse. Reinforce the pubocervical fascia using sutures to support the bladder base.
Posterior colporrhaphy: Indicated for posterior compartment prolapse. Reinforce the rectovaginal fascia to correct rectocele or enterocele.
Sacrocolpopexy: Considered for apical prolapse. Attach the vaginal vault or cervix to the sacral promontory using synthetic mesh.
Sacrospinous fixation: Alternative for apical prolapse, particularly after hysterectomy. Attach the vaginal apex to the sacrospinous ligament.
The use of mesh in surgical repair has been controversial due to high complication rates. In the UK, it should only be used when non-mesh methods have failed or are not suitable, following informed consent about potential risks and benefits.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may also play a role in management. Topical oestrogens can improve vaginal atrophy and potentially enhance outcomes of other treatments, although evidence is limited.
Finally, for management of associated urinary incontinence, NICE guidelines recommend offering a trial of supervised pelvic floor muscle training for at least 3 months before considering surgical options such as midurethral sling procedures.
