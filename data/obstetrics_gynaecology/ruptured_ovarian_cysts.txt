Ruptured ovarian cysts
Ruptured ovarian cysts
Ruptured ovarian cysts are a common gynaecological emergency. The most common symptoms include sudden onset of severe
lower
abdominal pain
, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Physical examination may reveal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the lower abdomen. Imaging studies such as ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis and help identify any associated complications such as haemoperitoneum or abscess formation. Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms and the presence of complications. Conservative management with pain control and observation is appropriate for stable patients with mild symptoms. However, surgical intervention may be necessary for patients with severe symptoms, haemodynamic instability, or evidence of complications. Laparoscopic surgery is the preferred approach for most cases, but laparotomy may be necessary in some situations.

Aetiology
Ruptured ovarian cysts can occur spontaneously or after physical activities such as vigorous exercise, sexual intercourse, or trauma to the abdomen. The rupture may be due to increased intra-abdominal pressure, torsion of the cyst's pedicle, or vascular compromise.

Clinical features
Patients with ruptured ovarian cysts typically present with acute onset of unilateral lower
abdominal pain
that may radiate to the back or thigh. However, clinical manifestations can vary depending on factors such as the size and type of the cyst and whether complications have developed.
Pain:
Sudden onset of severe
pelvic pain
is the most common symptom associated with a ruptured ovarian cyst. The pain is usually sharp and localized to one side but can also be diffuse and generalized.
Peritoneal signs:
Rupture of an ovarian cyst may cause irritation of the peritoneum leading to rebound tenderness, guarding, and rigidity upon physical examination.
Haemodynamic instability:
In cases where significant intraperitoneal bleeding occurs due to the rupture of a vascularized cyst (e.g., endometrioma), patients may present with tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis, and syncope.
Gastrointestinal symptoms:
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation may be present due to irritation of adjacent gastrointestinal structures by released cystic contents.
Urinary symptoms:
Dysuria and urinary frequency may occur if there is inflammation or compression of the urinary tract structures.
Fever:
In rare cases, rupture of an infected ovarian cyst (e.g., tubo-ovarian abscess) may lead to fever and systemic signs of infection.
Physical Examination Findings
Abdominal examination:
Tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness may be present in the lower abdomen corresponding to the affected ovary.
Pelvic examination:
Unilateral adnexal tenderness and fullness may be appreciated on bimanual examination, indicating the presence of a ruptured cyst or associated hematoma.
Speculum examination:
Vaginal discharge or bleeding may be observed if there is communication between the ruptured cyst and vagina or if there is concurrent cervical pathology.

Differential diagnosis
The clinical presentation of a ruptured ovarian cyst can mimic various other conditions, necessitating a thorough evaluation to rule out alternative diagnoses. Some common differentials include:
Ectopic pregnancy
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Appendicitis
Torsion of the ovary or adnexa
Urolithiasis
Diverticulitis
