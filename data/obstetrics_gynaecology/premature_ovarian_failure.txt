Premature ovarian failure
Premature ovarian failure
Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a condition that affects women under the age of 40, where the ovaries stop functioning normally and ovulation ceases. This can lead to infertility, as well as other symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes. POF can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic disorders, autoimmune diseases, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Diagnosis is made through blood tests to measure hormone levels and imaging studies to evaluate the ovaries. Treatment options include hormone replacement therapy to alleviate symptoms and prevent osteoporosis, as well as fertility treatments if needed.
