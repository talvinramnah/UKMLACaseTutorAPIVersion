Management
Options depend on the severity of symptoms
mild symptoms can be managed with lifestyle advice
apart from the usual advice on sleep, exercise, smoking and alcohol, specific advice includes regular, frequent (2-3 hourly), small, balanced meals rich in complex carbohydrates
moderate symptoms may benefit from a new-generation combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)
examples include YasminÂµ (drospirenone 3 mg and ethinylestradiol 0.030 mg)
severe symptoms may benefit from a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
this may be taken continuously or just during the luteal phase (for example days 15-28 of the menstrual cycle, depending on its length)
