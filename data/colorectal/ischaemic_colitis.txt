Ischaemic colitis
Ischaemic colitis
IIschaemic colitis describes an acute but transient compromise in the blood flow to the large bowel. This may lead to inflammation, ulceration and haemorrhage. It is more likely to occur in 'watershed' areas such as the splenic flexure that are located at the borders of the territory supplied by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries.
Treatment involves supportive care, such as bowel rest and intravenous fluids, as well as addressing any underlying medical conditions. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

Clinical features
Onset and Duration
Patients with ischaemic colitis typically present with an acute onset of symptoms, although some cases may have a subacute or even chronic presentation. The duration of symptoms varies depending on the severity and underlying aetiology but generally lasts for several days.
Abdominal pain
The most common clinical feature is abdominal pain, which is usually localized to the left lower quadrant or suprapubic region corresponding to the affected segment of the colon. Pain may be crampy in nature and can range from mild to severe intensity.
Rectal bleeding
Passage of bright red blood per rectum or bloody
diarrhoea
is another common symptom in patients suffering from ischaemic colitis. Haematochezia usually occurs within 24 hours after the onset of abdominal pain.
Bowel habit changes
Altered bowel habits are frequently observed in patients with ischaemic colitis, including diarrhoea, urgency, tenesmus, or less commonly constipation.
Nausea and vomiting
These symptoms may be present but are non-specific and could indicate other gastrointestinal disorders.
Systemic signs
Fever
and
tachycardia
might be present in severe cases, indicating systemic involvement or progressing towards gangrenous colitis.
Physical Examination
Abdominal examination: Upon inspection, there might be abdominal distension. Palpation may reveal localized tenderness or guarding in the affected area, most commonly in the left lower quadrant.
Rectal examination: Digital rectal examination (DRE) can provide valuable information regarding the presence of blood or melena, as well as assessing for any masses or strictures.
Signs of shock: In severe cases or those with extensive bowel involvement, patients may present with signs of hypovolemic shock such as tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status.
Peripheral vascular examination: A comprehensive vascular assessment should be performed to identify any peripheral arterial disease that might contribute to the development of ischaemic colitis.
