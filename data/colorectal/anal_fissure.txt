Anal fissure
Anal fissure
Anal fissures are longitudinal tears in the anoderm, commonly caused by increased anal resting pressure, trauma, and constipation. Patients typically present with severe
anal pain
,
rectal bleeding
, pruritus ani, and constipation. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, with additional investigations when needed.
Management includes conservative measures (sitz baths, stool softeners, fibre supplementation, and topical analgesics), medical treatment (topical nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, and botulinum toxin injection), and surgical intervention (lateral internal sphincterotomy) for refractory cases.

Aetiology
Anal fissures are longitudinal tears in the anoderm, the specialized squamous epithelium that lines the distal anal canal. Although they can affect individuals of any age and gender, they are most commonly found in young adults and middle-aged individuals. The aetiology of anal fissures can be broadly classified into primary (idiopathic) and secondary causes.
Primary (idiopathic) anal fissures
The majority of anal fissures are idiopathic in nature, with no clear underlying cause. However, several factors have been proposed to contribute to the development of these fissures, including:
Increased anal resting pressure:
Elevated internal anal sphincter (IAS) pressure is a common finding in patients with anal fissures. This increased pressure may reduce blood flow to the anoderm, predisposing it to ischemic injury and impaired healing.
Trauma:
Minor trauma to the anoderm, such as that resulting from the passage of hard stools, can result in anal fissures. This is particularly true in individuals with underlying predisposing factors, such as increased anal resting pressure or a history of chronic constipation.
Constipation and straining:
Chronic constipation and straining during defecation can lead to increased pressure within the anal canal, predisposing the anoderm to injury and fissure formation.
Secondary anal fissures
Secondary anal fissures are less common and are usually associated with specific underlying conditions or risk factors, including:
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):
Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can cause anal fissures, with the inflammation of the rectum and anus leading to increased susceptibility to anodermal injury.
Infectious causes:
Infections, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can lead to anal fissures. Examples include syphilis, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Malignancy:
Anal fissures can be a presenting symptom of anal or rectal malignancies, such as anal carcinoma or rectal cancer.
Other causes:
Other causes of secondary anal fissures include radiation proctitis, trauma, and iatrogenic injury (e.g., following surgical procedures).

Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of anal fissures involves a combination of mechanical, ischemic, and inflammatory factors that ultimately contribute to the development and persistence of these lesions.
Mechanical factors:
Trauma to the anoderm, such as the passage of a hard stool, can cause micro-tears in the tissue, initiating the fissure formation. Repeated trauma or strain can exacerbate the condition, preventing the fissure from healing and leading to a chronic fissure.
Ischaemic factors:
Increased resting pressure in the internal anal sphincter can result in reduced blood flow to the anoderm, causing ischemia and impairing the healing process. This creates a cycle of injury and non-healing, contributing to the development of chronic anal fissures.
Inflammatory factors:
Inflammation in the anoderm and anal canal, whether due to underlying inflammatory conditions (e.g., IBD), infection, or local trauma, can predispose an individual to anal fissure formation. Inflammatory mediators may further impair the healing process by promoting tissue breakdown and inhibiting the normal reparative response.
Chronic anal fissures:
Chronic anal fissures are characterized by fibrosis and hypertrophy of the anal papilla and sentinel pile formation. These changes can further exacerbate the mechanical and ischemic factors contributing to the non-healing fissure. Prolonged inflammation and ischemia in the area can also lead to the development of granulation tissue, which may further impair the healing process.

Classification
Classification of Anal Fissures
Anal fissures are classified based on their duration, location, and aetiology, which helps guide appropriate management strategies.
Classification by Duration
Acute anal fissures
: Present for less than 6 weeks, these fissures typically have sharp, well-defined edges without evidence of chronicity.
Acute fissures generally respond well to conservative management.
They appear as simple tears in the anoderm without associated features of chronicity.
Chronic anal fissures
: Present for more than 6 weeks, these fissures demonstrate features of chronicity.
Characterised by exposed internal anal sphincter fibres at the base of the fissure.
Associated with a hypertrophied anal papilla proximally and a sentinel skin tag distally.
Often demonstrate indurated edges due to fibrosis and granulation tissue.
Usually require medical or surgical intervention as they are less responsive to conservative measures.
Classification by Location
Posterior midline fissures
: Most common location (80-90% of cases).
More prevalent in both males and females due to anatomical factors including reduced blood supply to the posterior commissure.
The posterior midline is particularly vulnerable to trauma during defecation.
Anterior midline fissures
: Less common (10-20% of cases).
More frequently seen in females, particularly those who have given birth.
May be associated with weakened anterior sphincter support.
Atypical or lateral fissures
: Uncommon location that should raise suspicion for underlying pathology.
Multiple or off-midline fissures warrant further investigation for secondary causes.
According to the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) guidelines, atypical fissures should prompt consideration of underlying conditions such as Crohn's disease, HIV, tuberculosis, or malignancy.
Classification by Aetiology
Primary (idiopathic) fissures
: Most common type with no identifiable underlying cause.
Typically occur in the posterior or anterior midline.
Associated with increased anal resting pressure and relative ischaemia.
Secondary fissures
: Result from an identifiable underlying condition.
Associated with inflammatory bowel disease (particularly Crohn's disease)
May result from infectious causes (HIV, tuberculosis, syphilis, herpes)
Can be related to malignancy (anal or rectal cancer)
Other causes include trauma, radiation proctitis, and chemotherapy

Clinical features
Patients with anal fissures typically present with a constellation of symptoms that may vary in severity and duration. The following are the key presenting features of anal fissures:
Pain: Pain is the most common and characteristic symptom of anal fissures. It is typically described as sharp, severe, and localized to the anus. Pain is usually most intense during and immediately after bowel movements, often persisting for several minutes to hours. In some cases, the pain can be so severe that it leads to avoidance of bowel movements and subsequent constipation.
Bleeding:
Rectal bleeding
is another common symptom of anal fissures. The blood is usually bright red and noticed on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement. Bleeding is typically minimal and self-limited, but it may be persistent in chronic fissures.
Pruritus ani: Itching around the anus (pruritus ani) may occur in patients with anal fissures, particularly in chronic cases. This symptom may be exacerbated by the presence of local inflammation or secondary infection.
Discharge: Some patients may experience a mucopurulent discharge from the fissure, which can cause perianal irritation and contribute to pruritus ani.
Constipation: Patients with anal fissures may develop constipation due to the avoidance of bowel movements as a result of the pain associated with defecation. This can create a vicious cycle, as constipation and straining can further exacerbate the fissure.
The following are key findings on physical examination:
Visual inspection of the perianal area may reveal erythema, oedema, or discharge. Anal fissures are typically located in the posterior midline (90% of cases) or the anterior midline (10% of cases). The fissure appears as a linear tear in the anoderm and may be associated with a sentinel pile (hypertrophied skin tag) at its distal end.
Gentle palpation of the perianal area may reveal localized tenderness or induration. In some cases, the sentinel pile can be palpated as a small, firm nodule.
A Digital rectal examination (DRE) should be performed with caution, as it can be extremely painful for patients with anal fissures. However, it is crucial for assessing the tone of the anal sphincters, as well as for identifying any masses, strictures, or other abnormalities.

Management
Management of an acute anal fissure (< 6 weeks)
dietary advice: high-fibre diet with high fluid intake
bulk-forming laxatives are first-line - if not tolerated then lactulose should be tried
lubricants such as petroleum jelly may be tried before defecation
topical anaesthetics
analgesia
topical steroids do not provide significant relief
Management of a chronic anal fissure (> 6 weeks)
the above techniques should be continued
topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is first-line treatment for a chronic anal fissure
if topical GTN is not effective after 8 weeks then secondary care referral should be considered for surgery or botulinum toxin
