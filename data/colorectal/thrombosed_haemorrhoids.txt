Thrombosed haemorrhoids
Thrombosed haemorrhoids
Thrombosed
haemorrhoids
are a common condition that can cause significant discomfort and pain for patients. They occur when blood clots form within the haemorrhoidal veins, leading to swelling, inflammation, and pain. Patients may present with symptoms such as
rectal bleeding
,
anal pain
, and a lump or swelling around the anus.
Diagnosis is usually made through physical examination, although additional tests such as anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy may be required in some cases. Treatment options include conservative measures such as sitz baths, topical creams, and pain relief medication, as well as more invasive procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, or surgical excision.

Aetiology
Thrombosed
haemorrhoids
are a common clinical condition, characterised by the acute onset of
perianal pain
and swelling. They are associated with several risk factors and underlying causes, which can be categorised into lifestyle-related factors, medical conditions, and physiological changes.
Lifestyle-Related Factors
Sedentary behaviour:
Prolonged sitting or standing can increase intra-abdominal pressure and strain on the anal region leading to haemorrhoidal disease.
Diet:
Low fibre intake can lead to constipation, resulting in increased straining during defecation. This excessive straining increases pressure in the rectal veins, contributing to haemorrhoid formation.
Obesity:
Increased body mass index (BMI) has been linked to a higher incidence of haemorrhoids due to increased intra-abdominal pressure.
Alcohol and caffeine consumption:
These substances may lead to dehydration and subsequent constipation, increasing the risk of haemorrhoids.
Medical Conditions
Cirrhosis of the liver:
This condition can cause portal hypertension leading to increased pressure within the venous system including the hemorrhoidal plexus.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):
Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may result in frequent diarrhoea which can irritate anorectal tissues causing inflammation that contributes to haemorrhoid development.
Pregnancy:
The gravid uterus exerts increased pressure on the pelvic veins leading to venous congestion in the haemorrhoidal plexus. Additionally, hormonal changes can cause dilation of veins.
Chronic cough:
Persistent increase in intra-abdominal pressure from chronic coughing can lead to haemorrhoid development.
Physiological Changes
Ageing:
The risk of developing haemorrhoids increases with age due to weakening of the supporting tissues within the anal canal.
Anal intercourse:
This may cause direct trauma and subsequent inflammation or thrombosis of haemorrhoidal tissue.

Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of thrombosed
haemorrhoids
involves a series of interconnected processes that culminate in the formation of swollen and inflamed vascular structures in the anal canal. This section will elucidate these processes, shedding light on the mechanisms that underlie this common condition.
Vascular Structure and Haemorrhoidal Plexuses
The rectum and anal canal are richly vascularised by a network of veins known as haemorrhoidal plexuses. These plexuses, particularly those located in the submucosa of the distal rectum, play a critical role in maintaining faecal continence. A disruption or dysfunction within these vascular networks can lead to the development of haemorrhoids.
Venous Stasis and Dilatation
Haemorrhoid formation often begins with venous stasis, which refers to slowed or stagnant blood flow within the veins. This can result from increased intra-abdominal pressure due to factors such as straining during defecation or prolonged sitting. The consequent venous pressure increase leads to dilatation of these vessels, initiating the formation of haemorrhoids.
Thrombus Formation
A critical step in the progression towards thrombosed haemorrhoids is thrombus formation. Under conditions of venous stasis and dilatation, blood flow may become sufficiently sluggish to promote coagulation. The resultant clot, or thrombus, further exacerbates local inflammation and swelling.
Local Inflammation and Swelling
The presence of a thrombus triggers an inflammatory response characterised by infiltration with immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages. This inflammation contributes to the swelling and pain associated with thrombosed haemorrhoids.
Compounding this issue, the dilated vessels in the haemorrhoidal plexuses can become more permeable, leading to fluid leakage into the surrounding tissue. This further increases swelling and discomfort.
Manifestations of Thrombosed Haemorrhoids
The pathophysiological processes outlined above culminate in the clinical manifestations commonly associated with thrombosed haemorrhoids. These include rectal pain, itching, bleeding during defecation, and a palpable mass in the anal area.
The severity of these symptoms can vary depending on factors such as the size and location of the haemorrhoid, as well as individual patient characteristics.

Clinical features
Patients with thrombosed
haemorrhoids
often present with a sudden onset of symptoms, frequently following activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as heavy lifting, straining during defecation, or prolonged sitting. The duration of symptoms can vary; however, spontaneous resolution usually occurs within 7-10 days as the thrombus becomes organized and reabsorbed.
Pain
Severe pain is a hallmark feature of thrombosed haemorrhoids due to inflammation and oedema caused by the occlusion of blood flow within the affected vascular channels. The intensity of pain may be exacerbated during bowel movements or when sitting for extended periods. It is essential to differentiate between pain originating from thrombosed haemorrhoids and other anorectal pathologies, such as anal fissures or abscesses.
Perianal Swelling
Physical examination may reveal perianal swelling in patients with thrombosed haemorrhoids. The overlying skin may appear erythematous, tense or shiny, indicating inflammation and increased pressure within the hemorrhoidal tissue.
Palpable Mass
Upon digital rectal examination or inspection, a firm, tender mass may be palpated at the anal verge in cases involving external thrombosis. This mass represents the engorged hemorrhoidal tissue containing the blood clot.
Bleeding
Although less common than in non-thrombosed haemorrhoids, patients may report mild bleeding associated with thrombosed haemorrhoids. This bleeding typically occurs during defecation and may be evidenced by bright red blood on the toilet paper or coating the stool. It is crucial to differentiate this type of bleeding from that caused by other anorectal or gastrointestinal disorders.
Prolapse
In rare instances, thrombosed internal haemorrhoids may prolapse through the anal canal and become visible externally. These cases may present with additional symptoms such as mucus discharge or faecal soiling.
Associated Symptoms
Patients with thrombosed haemorrhoids may also experience pruritus ani (itching around the anus) due to irritation from inflammation or secondary infection.

Differential diagnosis
Thrombosed
haemorrhoids
can often be mistaken for other anal and rectal conditions due to similarities in clinical presentation. It is essential to differentiate between these conditions to ensure appropriate treatment. The three most common conditions that mimic thrombosed haemorrhoids are anal fissures, perianal abscesses, and rectal prolapse.
Anal Fissures:
The primary distinction between anal fissures and thrombosed haemorrhoids lies in the nature of pain experienced by patients. While thrombosed haemorrhoids result in constant pain exacerbated by bowel movements or sitting, anal fissures typically cause severe, sharp pain during defecation which subsides afterwards.
On physical examination, a tear or ulceration in the anoderm can be seen in cases of anal fissure. In contrast, thrombosed haemorrhoids present as bluish, tender swellings at the anus.
Bleeding associated with anal fissures is usually bright red and noticed on toilet paper after wiping. In comparison, bleeding from thrombosed haemorrhoids is less common but when present, it tends to occur during defecation.
Perianal Abscesses:
Perianal abscesses also present with severe pain; however, this tends to be more intense than that experienced with thrombosed haemorrhoids and may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise - features not commonly seen in thrombosis of haemorrhoidal tissue.
A fluctuant mass may be palpable on examination in case of a perianal abscess which distinguishes it from the firm, tender mass seen in thrombosed haemorrhoids.
The presence of purulent discharge from the anus is a distinctive feature of perianal abscesses but is not associated with thrombosed haemorrhoids.
Rectal Prolapse:
Patients with rectal prolapse often report a feeling of incomplete evacuation and
rectal bleeding
, which can also be symptoms in cases of thrombosed haemorrhoids. However, the hallmark symptom of rectal prolapse is the protrusion of a mass from the anus, especially during defecation.
A crucial differentiating factor is that while thrombosed haemorrhoids are usually painful, rectal prolapse is typically painless.
On examination, circumferential folds may be observed in cases of rectal prolapse as opposed to the discrete swellings seen in thrombosed haemorrhoids.

Management
Initial Management
Prescribe topical anaesthetics or oral analgesics for pain relief.
Suggest sitz baths and stool softeners to alleviate discomfort and prevent constipation, respectively.
Outpatient Procedures
If symptoms persist after initial management, consider outpatient procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy or infrared coagulation. These are usually effective for internal
haemorrhoids
but can also be used in some cases of thrombosed external haemorrhoids.
Rubber band ligation is the most common procedure. It involves placing a band around the base of the haemorrhoid causing it to shrink and fall off within a week.
Sclerotherapy involves injecting a chemical solution into the haemorrhoid tissue causing it to shrink.
Infrared coagulation uses heat to cause scar tissue which cuts off the blood supply to the haemorrhoid.
Surgical Intervention
If outpatient procedures are unsuccessful or inappropriate, consider surgical intervention. This includes haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy, usually reserved for large or persistent thrombosed haemorrhoids that don't respond to less invasive treatments.
A haemorrhoidectomy involves surgically removing the excessive tissue that's causing bleeding.
Stapled haemorrhoidopexy is an alternative procedure where a circular stapling device is used to remove haemorrhoidal tissue and reposition the remaining healthy tissue back inside the anus. This method has less post-operative pain but may have higher recurrence rates compared with traditional surgery.
