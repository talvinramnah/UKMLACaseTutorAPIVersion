Pilonidal sinus
Pilonidal sinus
Pilonidal sinus is a common condition that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue in the sacrococcygeal region. It is characterized by the formation of a cyst or abscess that contains hair, debris, and bacteria. The condition is more common in men than women and is often associated with a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and poor hygiene. Patients typically present with pain, swelling, and discharge from the affected area.
Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and imaging studies. Treatment options include conservative management with antibiotics and drainage of the abscess, or surgical excision of the sinus tract. Recurrence rates are high, and patients should be advised to maintain good hygiene and avoid prolonged sitting.

Clinical features
Patients with pilonidal sinus may present with various signs and symptoms depending on the stage and severity of the disease. The clinical manifestations can be broadly categorized into three stages:
Asymptomatic stage: In this stage, patients may have a small pit or opening in the skin (pilonidal dimple) without any active inflammation or infection. They may not report any pain or discomfort but might notice an intermittent discharge from the dimple.
Acute abscess formation: This stage is characterized by the sudden onset of severe pain, erythema, swelling, and warmth in the sacrococcygeal area due to acute infection within the sinus tract. Patients may also experience systemic symptoms such as
fever
and
malaise
.
Chronic sinus tract formation: In this stage, patients develop persistent drainage from one or more external openings in the natal cleft region due to chronic inflammation and infection within the sinus tract(s). The discharge may be purulent or serosanguinous in nature and can be associated with an unpleasant odour.
A thorough physical examination should focus on the inspection and palpation of the sacrococcygeal area. Key findings may include:
Pilonidal Dimple: A small, indented opening in the skin overlying the sacrococcygeal region.
Erythema, Swelling, and Tenderness: Indicative of acute inflammation or infection within the sinus tract.
Fluctuance: Suggestive of an underlying abscess formation that might require incision and drainage.
Sinus Tract Openings: One or more external openings
