Idiopathic pruritus ani
Idiopathic
pruritus ani
is a common condition characterized by intense itching around the anus, which can be chronic and debilitating. The exact cause of this condition is unknown, but it is believed to be multifactorial, with factors such as faecal contamination, skin irritation, and psychological stress playing a role. Patients with idiopathic pruritus ani often experience significant discomfort and embarrassment, which can negatively impact their quality of life.
Diagnosis of idiopathic pruritus ani is based on clinical presentation and exclusion of other potential causes of anal itching. Treatment options include lifestyle modifications, topical therapies, and surgical interventions. Lifestyle modifications such as avoiding irritants and maintaining good hygiene can be effective in reducing symptoms. Topical therapies such as corticosteroids can also provide relief.

Clinical features
Patients with idiopathic
pruritus ani
typically present with persistent or intermittent itching localized to the perianal area. The intensity of pruritus may vary from mild to severe and can be exacerbated by factors such as moisture, heat, physical activity, and stress. Some patients may also report a burning or stinging sensation in addition to itchiness.
Upon inspection of the perianal region, erythema and excoriation may be observed due to persistent scratching. In more severe cases, lichenification or hyperpigmentation can develop as a result of chronic irritation. Fissures or secondary infections may also be present if there has been significant skin breakdown.

Management
Management
Treat any secondary causes
General measures include loose clothing, good personal hygiene, talcum powder to absorb moisture
Barrier creams: Apply a thin layer of zinc oxide paste or petroleum jelly to protect the perianal skin from further irritation due to moisture or friction.
Mild short-term topical steroids may be required to break the scratch-itch cycle
Antihistamines: Non-sedating antihistamines such as cetirizine or loratadine can help alleviate itching. Sedating antihistamines like hydroxyzine may also provide symptomatic relief, particularly at night when pruritus tends to worsen.
