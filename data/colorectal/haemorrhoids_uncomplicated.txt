Haemorrhoids (uncomplicated)
Haemorrhoidal tissue is part of the normal anatomy which contributes to anal continence. These mucosal vascular cushions are found in the left lateral, right posterior and right anterior portions of the anal canal (3 o'clock, 7'o'clock and 11 o'clock respectively).

are said to exist when they become enlarged, congested and symptomatic

Management
Management
soften stools: increase dietary fibre and fluid intake
topical local anaesthetics and steroids may be used to help symptoms
outpatient treatments: rubber band ligation is superior to injection sclerotherapy
surgery is reserved for large symptomatic
haemorrhoids
which do not respond to outpatient treatments
newer treatments: Doppler guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation, stapled haemorrhoidopexy
