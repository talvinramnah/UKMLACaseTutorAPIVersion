Large bowel obstruction
Large bowel obstruction
A large bowel obstruction (herein, LBO) occurs when there is a blockage in the large bowel, either partial or complete, leading to an interruption of the normal flow of intra-luminal gastric contents. It is an important condition to identify, as it requires urgent medical or surgical treatment, particularly in the case of a complete obstruction. If left untreated, it can lead to significant morbidity, with a mortality of up to 40% if there is subsequent colonic perforation, therefore is an important cause of an acute abdomen to identify and promptly manage.

Aetiology
The causes of LBO are well known and therefore in any case of suspected obstruction, clear history taking, including identification of likely risk factors, needs to be elicited.
Carcinoma
Accounts for approximately 60% of LBO
LBO is the initial presenting complaint of colonic malignancy in approximately 30% of cases
This is particularly the case in more distal colonic and rectal tumours, as these tend to obstruct earlier due to the smaller lumen diameter
Common sites of malignancy
Rectosigmoid (70%)
Rectal (10%)
Anal (5%)
Other (15%)
Right sided obstructions are rare due to large diameter of the lumen and liquid consistency of faecal material (note: the features of these obstructions will mimic a distal
small bowel obstruction
more)
Volvulus
Volvulus is the most common
benign
cause of a LBO (10%)
Volvulus of the sigmoid colon is the most frequent
Twisting of the bowel on the mesentery leads to ischaemia and subsequent increased risk of perforation
Diverticular disease
Approximately 5% of cases
Normally this occurs in the sigmoid colon
Repeated bouts of diverticulitis can lead to subsequent scarring and muscular hypertrophy, eventually leading to formation of strictures and subsequent obstruction
Post-operative adhesions
Prior abdominal surgery can lead to post-operative adhesions and subsequent obstruction
Adhesions are far more likely to cause small bowel obstructions, however can infrequently cause LBO also
Less common
Hernia with colonic incarceration (2.5%)
Benign strictures (inflammatory, ischaemic, radiation-induced, anastomotic)
Severe faecal impaction
Intussusception
Intra-luminal foreign body

Pathophysiology
Obstruction of the large bowel means that no gastric contents or gas can pass through, therefore increased colonic pressure leads to dilation of the bowel proximal to the site of obstruction. With ongoing dilation and pressure, the blood flow to the bowel through the mesenteric system is reduced, therefore resulting in a compromised blood supply to the affected segment. As a result, this can lead to bowel mucosal ulceration, full thickness wall necrosis, and potentially subsequent perforation.
Perforation of the bowel results in release of faecal matter into the peritoneal cavity. This can lead to widespread bacterial infection and subsequent sepsis. The most common sources of infection in such an event include:
Escherichia coli
Enterococcus faecalis
Bacteroides species
With ongoing increases in bowel colonic pressure, there is compression of intestinal veins and lymphatics, leading to worsening bowel wall oedema. Such oedema further causes compression of intestinal arterioles and capillaries, leading to worsening of bowel ischaemia. Ongoing ischaemia leads to subsequent anaerobic metabolism, and lysis of the ischaemic cells causes increase in lactic acid and release of intracellular potassium, potentially resulting in metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.
Furthermore, with ongoing oedema, there is altered secretion of electrolytes and fluids into the colon lumen, leading to fluid shifts and subsequent hypotension and further electrolyte disturbances.

Clinical features
In the case of a LBO, it is important to not only identify the clinical features suggesting an obstruction, but also potentially the features of the
cause
of the obstruction itself.
Symptoms of bowel obstruction
Absence of passing flatus (90%) or stool (80%)
In complete obstruction this is absolute
Passing of some flatus or faeces may suggest a partial obstruction
Abdominal pain
(65%)
Continuous, rather than intermittent and colicky
Usually infra-umbilical region
Sudden relief of pain followed by progressive worsening may suggest perforation
Abdominal distention (65%)
Nausea and vomiting are late symptoms
If present, is likely intermittent and faeculent in nature
More suggestive of
proximal
LBO
Signs of bowel obstruction
Abdominal distention (65%)
Tender abdomen
Diffuse tenderness
Peritonism (if vascular compromise or perforation)
Guarding
Rebound tenderness
Abdominal rigidity
Signs suggestive of shock (hypotension, tachycardia, fever)
Hypoactive bowel sounds
May be normal at presentation, but may become more quiet and eventually silent in complete obstruction
Due to cessation of peristalsis
Clinical features suggestive of etiology
Colonic malignancy
Unexpected weight loss and loss of appetite
History of rectal bleeding mixed with stools
History of altered bowel habits
Volvulus
More rapid symptom onset
May have a previous history of prior volvulus
Sigmoid diverticulitis
History of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and tenderness
Left lower quadrant pain
Fever
Palpable mass

Investigations
The key investigation in making the diagnosis of LBO is abdominal imaging, usually via plain radiography or computed tomography (CT) scanning. However, it is important to also order a number of routine laboratory tests also to assess for the presence of metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities which can result from the LBO itself, or to assess for signs of potential complications (e.g. perforation and subsequent sepsis).
Routine laboratory tests
Full blood count
Microcytic anaemia may be present as a result of colonic malignancy
Presence of leukocytosis may suggest peritonitis and sepsis
Electrolytes and urea
May be normal in early stages of obstruction
Hypokalaemia may be present in late stages due to fluid shifts and disruption in normal exchange of electrolytes in the colon
Blood gases
Low serum bicarbonate levels, low blood pH and high lactic acid levels may be suggestive of intestinal ischaemia
Liver function tests
To exclude biliary or hepatic pathology as cause of
abdominal pain
Usually normal in LBO
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
To
consider
, not normally first line
Elevated CEA is suggestive of malignancy, and may guide diagnosis
Plain X-Ray
BMJ best practice recommend this as a first-line form of imaging, although some may proceed straight to CT due to higher sensitivity and ability to identify aetiology of obstruction more easily
Plain X-ray has a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 72% for identifying LBO
Will reveal marked colonic distention
Normal diameter limits are 10-12 cm for caecum, 8 cm for ascending colon, and 6.5 cm for recto-sigmoid
Diameter greater than this is diagnostic of obstruction
May reveal particular aetiologies:
Sigmoid volvulus : distended sigmoid colon in right upper quadrant, dilated inverted U-shaped loop of colon projected towards the right side of abdomen
Colonic volvulus: 'coffee bean sign', whereby apposition of the medial walls of the dilated bowel form the cleft of the coffee bean, and the lateral walls form the outer walls of the coffee bean
Presence of free intra-peritoneal gas indicates colonic perforation
Computed tomography
UptoDate recommend proceeding to abdominal CT scanning in patients who are haemodynamically stable and not requiring
immediate
intervention, due to the high sensitivity and specificity for identifying obstruction (over 90% each) as well as identifying the aetiology of obstruction itself
Features on CT scanning suggestive of LBO are a transition point with proximal dilated colon of greater than 8cm, and collapsed distal colon to this point
Provides more information regarding aetiology of obstruction, as plain x-ray can miss the diagnosis of volvulus in approximately 1/3 of cases
Contrast enema
Contrast enemas are particularly useful to differentiate between a mechanical LBO and a pseudo-obstruction
Will define the level of obstruction
Contrast will flow freely to the point of obstruction, with minimal or no flow past the site of obstruction
In colonic volvulus, an enema may reveal a 'bird's beak sign', with a gradual narrowing/tapering of contrast up to the point of obstruction
In some circumstances, the enema may be therapeutic by dislodging faeces in the case of faecal impaction
This investigation is
contraindicated
in cases of perforation due to leakage of contrast into the abdominal cavity and subsequent irritation

Differential diagnosis
Small bowel obstructions
In 15% of cases, a LBO may present with features more classical of a SBO. This is because 15% of people have an incompetent ileo-caecal valve, therefore this will decompress the large bowel into the distal small bowel, therefore resembling a distal SBO instead
Similarities
Both can present with similar symptoms e.g.
abdominal pain
, tenderness, vomiting and
constipation
Both have similar risk factors and aetiology (e.g. volvulus, adhesions, malignancy)
Differences
SBO tends to present more acutely, whilst in LBO the majority of cases will present with a more gradual onset of symptoms
In SBO, abdominal pain tends to be intermittent and colicky, whilst in LBO the pain is more continuous
Vomiting is more common in SBO and is bilious in nature, whereas this is a late sign in LBO and tends to be faeculent when present
Abdominal tenderness is more focal in SBO, whilst generally is more diffuse in LBO
Pseudo-obstruction
Also known as 'Ogilvie's syndrome', where the clinical features are similar to a LBO, however there is absence of a mechanical or anatomical cause
Is likely caused by an impairment of the autonomic nervous system and resulting functional obstruction
Similarities
Difficult to differentiate from a LBO due to large cross-over in symptom profile
Both can present with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation and abdominal distention
Differences
Paradoxically, patients with pseudo-obstruction may present with diarrhoea (approximately 40% of patients) and this is uncommon in LBO
Generally the differentiating feature will be absence of mechanical obstruction on abdominal imaging, with evidence of proximal colonic dilatation
Often there is a history of a recent severe illness, injury or surgery e.g. severe chest infection, orthopaedic trauma, electrolyte imbalance
Toxic megacolon
Similarities
Both may present with abdominal pain and distention
Both will show evidence of colonic dilatation on abdominal imaging, although in toxic megacolon this is usually of the entire colon whilst in LBO is usually only proximal to the obstruction
Differences
Usually toxic megacolon is associated with a
Clostridium difficile
infection, therefore likely a history of antibiotic use
Patients are usually very unwell with signs of shock (e.g. fever, tachycardia, hypotension, poor capillary refill), while this is usually only present in LBO with perforation
Normally will present with diarrhoea, whilst this is uncommon in LBO
Toxic megacolon affects all age groups, whilst LBO is far more common in the elderly population

Management
The urgency of management largely depends on the occurrence or possibility of  large bowel perforation with the subsequent risk of faecal peritonitis. In some cases, conservative management may be all that is required. However, the management depends primarily on the aetiology of the bowel obstruction in the first place.
Supportive measures
BMJ best practice recommend that for patients where bowel perforation is not suspected, and if the cause of obstruction itself does not require surgery, conservative management for up to 72 hours can be trialled, after which further management may be required if there is no resolution
However, according to UptoDate, approximately 75% of patients eventually require surgical intervention
Patients with LBO should remain nil by mouth until resolution of the obstruction, both to prevent worsening of the obstruction but also  to prepare for possible surgery
Intravenous fluids will be required to prevent dehydration, as well as to correct any potential electrolyte imbalances
Nasogastric tube insertion
Required to decompress the bowel
To reduce flow of gas and gastric contents further towards the site of obstruction
Antibiotics
Will be required if any evidence of perforation, or pre-operatively if surgery is required
Surgery
If there is any overt peritonitis or evidence of bowel perforation, emergency surgery is necessary
In general, surgery will involve thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity, resection of perforated segment and ischaemic bowel, and address the underlying cause of the obstruction itself
Management according to aetiology of obstruction
Malignancy
According to BMJ best practice, the presence of malignancy requires surgical treatment as first-line management
Involves both relieving the bowel obstruction as well as resecting the malignant tumour
However, in high-risk patients who may not tolerate surgery, colonic stenting may be used instead as a form of bowel decompression and as palliation, as approximately half of patients presenting with an LBO due to malignancy are not be candidates for curative surgery
Sigmoid volvulus
In the case of sigmoid volvulus, endoscopic decompression is first-line, using either flexible or rigid sigmoidoscopy
If there is evidence of ischaemia, perforation or mucosal gangrene, surgical management is still required  in the first instance
UptoDate suggests that for low-risk patients who are likely to tolerate surgery, resection of the affected bowel is recommended due to the high rate of recurrence (approximately 50%)
Diverticular disease
Often surgical management is required due to stricture formation
According to BMJ best practice, these patients will usually undergo either a Hartmann's procedure, or a resection and primary anastomosis, with/without a proximal diverting stoma.
