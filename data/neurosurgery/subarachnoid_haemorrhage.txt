Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)
is a severe, life-threatening cerebrovascular event characterised by bleeding into the subarachnoid space. It is most commonly caused by the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, but can also occur due to arteriovenous malformations or head trauma. SAH presents clinically with sudden onset, severe headache often described as 'thunderclap', accompanied by
nausea
,
vomiting
, photophobia and
neck stiffness
. Neurological deficits may be present depending on the severity and location of the bleed.
The definitive diagnosis involves neuroimaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scan which shows blood in the subarachnoid space. If CT is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, lumbar puncture can be performed to detect xanthochromia. Management strategies include stabilisation of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, control of intracranial pressure and surgical intervention for source control.

Aetiology
The most common cause of SAH is
head injury
and this is called
traumatic SAH
. In the absence of trauma, SAH is termed
spontaneous SAH
. The rest of this note focuses on spontaneous SAH.
Causes of spontaneous SAH include:
intracranial aneurysm (saccular 'berry' aneurysms)
accounts for around 85% of cases
conditions associated with berry aneurysms include hypertension,
adult polycystic kidney disease
,
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
and coarctation of the aorta
arteriovenous malformation
pituitary apoplexy
mycotic (infective) aneurysms
Improve
Clinical features
Classical presenting features include:
headache
usually of sudden-onset ('thunderclap' or 'hit with a baseball bat')
severe ('worst of my life')
occipital
typically peaking in intensity within 1 to 5 minutes
there may be a history of a less severe 'sentinel' headache in the weeks prior to the presentation
nausea
and
vomiting
meningism (photophobia,
neck stiffness
)
altered consciousness: Levels can range from slight
drowsiness
to coma, indicative of the severity of the haemorrhage or associated complications like hydrocephalus
focal neurological signs
cranial nerve palsies: particularly affecting the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, leading to visual disturbances or diplopia
hemiparesis or hemiplegia: indicative of extensive bleeding or secondary ischaemia
speech disturbances: aphasia may occur if the dominant hemisphere is affected.
seizures
Examination fndings
fundoscopy: subhyaloid haemorrhages may be visible
meningeal signs: positive Kernig's or Brudzinski's signs may be elicited
papilloedema: though uncommon, may be present indicating
raised intracranial pressure
vital signs: hypertension is commonly observed; however, hypotension is a poor prognostic sign
ECG changes
transient ECG changes including ST elevation may be seen
this may be secondary to either autonomic neural stimulation from the hypothalamus or elevated levels of circulating catecholamines
Improve
Investigations
Investigation
non-contrast CT head is the first-line investigation of choice
acute blood (hyperdense/bright on CT) is typically distributed in the basal cisterns, sulci and in severe cases the ventricular system.
if CT head is done within 6 hours of symptom onset and is normal
new guidelines suggest not doing a lumbar puncture
consider an alternative diagnosis
if CT head is done more than 6 hours after symptom onset and is normal
do a lumber puncture (LP)
timing wise the LP should be performed at least
12 hours
following the onset of symptoms to allow the development of
xanthochromia (the result of red blood cell breakdown)
.
xanthochromia helps to distinguish true SAH from a 'traumatic tap' (blood introduced by the LP procedure).
as well as xanthochromia, CSF findings consistent with subarachnoid haemorrhage include a normal or raised opening pressure
if the CT shows evidence of a SAH
referral to
neurosurgery
to be made as soon as SAH is confirmed
After spontaneous SAH is confirmed, the aim of investigation is to identify a causative pathology that needs urgent treatment:
CT intracranial angiogram
(to identify a vascular lesion e.g. aneurysm or AVM)
+/- digital subtraction angiogram (catheter angiogram)
Improve
Management
Management of  a confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage
supportive
bed rest
analgesia
venous thromboembolism prophylaxis
discontinuation of antithrombotics (reversal of anticoagulation if present)
vasospasm is prevented using a course of oral
nimodipine
intracranial aneurysms are at risk of rebleeding and therefore require prompt intervention, preferably within 24 hours
most intracranial aneurysms are now treated with a coil by interventional neuroradiologists, but a minority require a craniotomy and clipping by a neurosurgeon
Improve
Complications
Complications of aneurysmal SAH:
re-bleeding
happens in around 10% of cases and most common in the first 12 hours
if rebleeding is suspected (e.g. sudden worsening of neurological symptoms) then a
repeat CT
should be arranged
associated with a high mortality (up to 70%)
hydrocephalus
hydrocephalus is temporarily treated with an external ventricular drain (CSF diverted into a bag at the bedside) or, if required, a long-term ventriculoperitoneal shunt
vasospasm
(also termed delayed cerebral ischaemia), typically 7-14 days after onset
ensure euvolaemia (normal blood volume)
consider treatment with a vasopressor if symptoms persist
hyponatraemia
(most typically due to syndrome inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (
SIADH
))
seizures
Improve
Prognosis
If SAH is untreated the prognosis is often poor: around 50% within 1 month of the haemorrhage, and of those who survive the first month, 50% will remain dependent for help with activities of daily living. However, survival improves to 85% in patients with confirmed SAH admitted to a specialist neurosurgical unit.
Important predictive factors in SAH:
conscious level on admission
age
amount of blood visible on CT head
