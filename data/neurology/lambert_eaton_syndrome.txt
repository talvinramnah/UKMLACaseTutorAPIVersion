Lambert-Eaton syndrome
Lambert-Eaton syndrome
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is seen in association with small cell lung cancer and to a lesser extent breast and ovarian cancer. It may also occur independently as an autoimmune disorder. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is caused by an antibody directed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel  in the peripheral nervous system.

Clinical features
Features
repeated muscle contractions lead to increased muscle strength (in contrast to myasthenia gravis)
in reality, this is seen in only 50% of patients and following prolonged muscle use muscle strength will eventually decrease
limb-girdle weakness (affects lower limbs first)
hyporeflexia
autonomic symptoms:
dry mouth
, impotence, difficulty micturating
ophthalmoplegia and
ptosis
not commonly a feature (unlike in myasthenia gravis)

Investigations
EMG
incremental response to repetitive electrical stimulation

Management
Management
treatment of underlying cancer
immunosuppression, for example with prednisolone and/or azathioprine
3,4-diaminopyridine is currently being trialled
works by blocking potassium channel efflux in the nerve terminal so that the action potential duration is increased. Calcium channels can then be open for a longer time and allow greater acetylcholine release to the stimulate muscle at the end plate
intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange may be beneficial
