Horner's syndrome
Horner's syndrome
Horner's syndrome is a rare condition that affects the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a range of symptoms such as drooping eyelids, constricted pupils, and decreased sweating on one side of the face. The underlying causes of Horner's syndrome can vary, including tumours, injuries, or neurological disorders affecting the sympathetic nerves. Diagnosis of Horner's syndrome involves a thorough physical examination, including an assessment of pupil size and response to light, as well as imaging tests to identify any underlying causes. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the syndrome.

Clinical features
Clinical features of Horner's syndrome
Anisocoria
Miosis
(constricted pupil) on the affected side
Relative pupillary dilation lag in darkness (2-8 seconds)
Ptosis
Partial ptosis due to weakness of Muller's muscle
Involvement of levator palpebrae superioris may lead to more pronounced ptosis
Facial Anhidrosis and Vasodilation
Ipsilateral loss of sweating (anhidrosis) over forehead, face, and neck regions
Facial vasodilation due to loss of sympathetic tone
Heterochromia Iridum (in congenital cases)
Lighter iris colour in the affected eye compared to contralateral eye
Due to a lack of melanin deposition during development
Enophthalmos (rare)
Slight posterior displacement of the eyeball within the orbit
Attributed to the loss of sympathetic innervation to orbital smooth muscles
