Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, degenerative neurological condition which characteristically leads to disordered control of bodily movements. It is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting 1-2 people per 1000 at any given time. The prevalence of this condition increases with age, with approximately 1% of people aged over 60-years-old being diagnosed with the condition. Due to the increase in the ageing population, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease is only expected to grow in the coming years.

Aetiology
Currently, the cause of Parkinson's disease still remains unknown. The pathophysiology of the condition has been well studied and understood, however the initial insult which results in the process is still not known. Despite an unclear aetiology, there are a number of protective and risk factors associated with the development of Parkinson's disease.
Protective factors
Smoking
The risk of Parkinson's disease is significantly lower for current smokers compared to non-smokers
Furthermore, the risk is also lower for past-smokers compared to non-smokers
The theory has been proposed that nicotine has a somewhat neuroprotective effect
Caffeine intake
Physical activity
Particularly aerobic exercise has been shown to be protective
Studies have shown a 30% reduction in the risk ratio if people undertake moderate-vigorous physical activity
Risk factors
Family history
Although Parkinson's disease is not a genetically inherited condition, there is some evidence to suggest that those with a family history are more likely to develop the condition
This is particularly evident if onset of disease is in people less than 50-years-old
Previous head injury
There is a current hypothesis that head injury increases the risk for developing Parkinson's disease, and this has been examined in multiple studies during past decades
Although at this point the evidence is unclear, there is still a thought that previous head injury does increase the risk for Parkinson's disease
This is particularly evident if there has been multiple head injuries, post-traumatic brain injury, and if the injury occurs in later life (>55 years old)

Pathophysiology
Parkinson's disease
is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), leading to dopamine deficiency in the striatum. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease involves several key processes:
The initiation of cell death in SNpc is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. This leads to increased oxidative stress due to an imbalance between the production and neutralisation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Increased oxidative stress results in damage to cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In particular, protein oxidation can lead to misfolding and aggregation.
A major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the accumulation of
Lewy bodies
, intracellular aggregates composed primarily of misfolded α-synuclein. Misfolded α-synuclein has a propensity to aggregate and forms insoluble fibrils that contribute to Lewy body formation.
Lewy bodies disrupt normal cellular functions, impairing neuronal communication and causing synaptic dysfunction. They also induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and disrupt protein degradation pathways, further contributing to neuronal death.
In addition to Lewy body formation, there is evidence for a role of neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Activation of microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, leads to chronic inflammation and exacerbates neuronal damage.
Neuronal loss in SNpc reduces dopamine availability in the striatum, resulting in motor symptoms characteristic of Parkinson's disease such as
bradykinesia
,
rigidity
, tremor at rest and postural instability.
This understanding informs therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression by targeting these processes: reducing oxidative stress; preventing α-synuclein aggregation; modulating neuroinflammation; and replacing lost dopaminergic neurons or restoring striatal dopamine levels.
Improve
Clinical features
The three cardinal features of Parkinson's disease are a
resting tremor
, muscle
rigidity
and
bradykinesia
. If these features are present, Parkinson's disease should immediately be suspected. At this point, it is imperative that people are referred quickly and untreated to a specialist with expertise in this condition, in order to optimise outcomes for the patient. Furthermore, alongside this triad of clinical features, there are a number of other symptoms and signs associated with this condition.
Motor symptoms
Tremor
The tremor is characteristically resting in nature, meaning it is exacerbated by rest, and improves when a person engages in purposeful actions
It is often described as 'pill-rolling', where a person appears to be rolling a pill or small, round object between the index finger and the thumb
Usually begins as a unilateral tremor, however as the condition progresses over time it tends to become bilateral
Often begins as an intermittent tremor, and as the disease progresses the tremor becomes more continuous
Present at onset of disease in 75% of patients
Muscle rigidity
Increased resistance to movement about a joint
Typically described as 'cogwheel rigidity', a ratchet-like start/stop movement through the range of joint motion, creating cogwheel-like jerks
Manifests for the patient as muscular stiffness, stooped posture, and reduced arm swing when walking
Present at onset in 80% of patients
Bradykinesia
Slowness of movements and delay in initiation
Progressive reduction in amplitude of repetitive movements
Typically manifests as a reduction in manual dexterity of finger movements (e.g. fastening buttons, picking up small items), difficulty standing from a seated position, and troubles when walking (e.g. dragging feet,
shuffling gait
)
Present at onset of disease in 80% of patients
Postural instability
This is also a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease, however it does not tend to be present at onset of disease, rather occurs in the later courses. Therefore this is not always considered a cardinal sign as it is not usually present at initial diagnosis
Is described as the tendency to fall and be unstable, due to the loss of centrally-mediated postural reflexes necessary to maintain an upright position
Once this begins, it can be a major contributor to morbidity and disability for patients, as it often contributes to falls and subsequent injuries, and is not particularly responsive to dopaminergic treatment
Other motor features
Mask-like facies (hypomimia), including decreased eye blinking
Hypo-kinetic dysarthria and speech impairment
Micrographia (abnormally small and cramped handwriting)
Dysphagia (due to bradykinesia of pharyngeal muscles)
Non-motor symptoms
Although Parkinson's disease characteristically affects the motor systems, over 95% of patients also report a number of non-motor symptoms throughout the disease course
Mood disturbance
Depression
(50%)
Apathy ( 40%)
Anxiety (30%)
Psychiatric symptoms
Psychotic episodes (may be due to dopaminergic medications, underlying Lewy-body dementia, or both)
Visual hallucinations
Paranoid delusions (typically patients have good insight)
Sleep dysfunction
Frequently restless legs syndrome, insomnia and daytime somnolence
Frequent awakening through the night and early morning waking are common, independent from depression
Improve
Investigations
The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is made clinically, rather than via investigations. The NICE guidelines recommend that the diagnosis is made using the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria, which is explained further below in the 'diagnostic criteria' section.
Investigations tend to be performed only when there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis, in order to distinguish it from other differentials.
Structural MRI
Structural MRIs are
not
recommended for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, however again may be considered if there are atypical features of disease which question the diagnosis
These may be features such as atypical course of disease, early onset of dementia, early autonomic dysfunction or visual gaze abnormalities
The MRI will be usually normal in a patient with Parkinson's disease, or there may be cortical atrophy in advanced disease with dementia
Absence of the 'swallow-tail-sign' (dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity on 3.0 Tesla susceptibility-weighted scan)
may
be seen, and if so, this reliably suggests neurodegenerative
parkinsonism
Can exclude structural abnormalities as the cause of the symptoms e.g. hydrocephalus, cerebral tumours, infarcts
Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
Useful to distinguish Parkinson's disease from an
essential tremor
, and vascular/drug-induced/psychogenic parkinsonism
The NICE guidelines recommend considering SPECT if the essential tremor cannot be clinically differentiated from parkinsonism
In Parkinson's disease, there will be a decreased basal ganglia (putaminal) pre-synaptic dopamine uptake
Olfactory testing
Although the NICE guidelines do not recommend use of olfactory testing for diagnosis, they may be useful to differentiate Parkinson's disease from other parkinsonian disorders
The BMJ best practice guidelines and UptoDate suggest that olfactory testing may still be useful, as hyposmia or anosmia is common in Parkinson's, and is a supporting feature under many diagnostic criteria
Olfactory tests available include:
The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test
Sniffin' Sticks test
Improve
Diagnosis
As per the NICE guidelines, Parkinson's disease should be diagnosed using the 'UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria'. These criteria closely align with what are considered the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease, and include a number of inclusion and exclusion criteria which should be considered in a three-step approach. All three steps are involved in coming to the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
1. Diagnosis of a Parkinsonian syndrome
Firstly, for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, it requires presence of
bradykinesia
(slowness in voluntary movement, reduced speed and amplitude of repetitive actions) plus at least one of the following:
Muscular
rigidity
Resting tremor
(4-6 Hz frequency)
Postural instability (not caused by a visual, vestibular, cerebellar or proprioceptive dysfunction)
Please note, these also align with the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria which can also be used, where diagnosis requires the presence of bradykinesia plus tremor or muscle rigidity, the triad of features considered central and essential to this disease
2. Exclusion criteria
Next, a diagnosis other than Parkinson's disease should be considered if any of multiple of the following criteria are present
History of repeated strokes with stepwise progression of parkinsonian clinical features
History of repeated head injury
History of definite encephalitis
History or current oculogyric crises
Neuroleptic treatment at time of symptom onset
More than one affected relative
Sustained remission
Strictly unilateral features after 3 years
(Note: Parkinson's progresses from unilateral to the contralateral side with time, but the initial side affected tends to remain more greatly impacted)
Supranuclear gaze palsy
Cerebellar signs
Early severe autonomic involvement
(Note: consider
multiple system atrophy
)
Early severe dementia with disturbances of memory, language, and praxis
Positive babinski sign
Presence of cerebral tumour or communication hydrocephalus on imaging
Negative response to large doses of levodopa in absence of malabsorption
MPTP exposure (a compound which causes selective degeneration of the substantia nigra, in users of illicit drug MPPP contaminated with MPTP)
3. Supportive positive criteria
Next, if at this point Parkinson's disease is still suspected, three or more of the following features are required for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease
These must be in addition to any criteria present in step 1 (i.e. if resting tremor was used in step 1, this cannot be one of the three additional criteria used in this section)
Unilateral onset
Resting tremor
Progressive disease
Persistent asymmetry, affecting initial side of onset most
Excellent response (70-100%) to levodopa treatment
Severe levodopa-induced chorea
Levodopa response for greater than 5 years
Clinical course of greater than 10 years
Other supportive criteria according to the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria include:
The presence of either olfactory loss or cardiac sympathetic denervation on metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG, iobenguane I-123) scintigraphy
Unequivocal and marked on-off fluctuations, which must have at some point included predictable end-of-dose wearing off
The presence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia
Improve
Differential diagnosis
There are a number of possible differential diagnoses for Parkinson's disease, as the characteristic clinical features can be present in a number of other neurological disorders. Therefore, in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, it may be difficult to distinguish these conditions and as a result, referral to a specialist with expertise in this area is paramount.
Essential tremor
In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, a tremor may be the prominent or only clinical symptom
An essential tremor is one of the most common causes of tremor, with an approximate prevalence of 5%, therefore this is a likely differential
Similarities
Both present with a tremor
Incidence of both increases with increasing age
Both tremors usually affect the hands and arms predominantly
Differences
An essential tremor worsens when holding the arms outstretched
An essential tremor worsens with activities such as writing, whereas the tremor associated with Parkinson's disease improves with purposeful actions
Most often is symmetrical, however can sometimes be asymmetric
Multiple system atrophy
Multiple system atrophy very frequently can be misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, as early in the course, they both appear very similar in symptom profile
Similarities
Both may initially present with parkinsonian features
Both may respond to levodopa therapy
Both have an element of autonomic dysfunction, although this tends to be more pronounced in multiple system atrophy
Differences
In multiple system atrophy, there is usually a degree of cerebellar involvement, which is part of the exclusion criteria for Parkinson's disease
Cognition is well preserved in multiple system atrophy
Lewy-body dementia
Both present very similar initially and the differentiation often comes after a period of time after Parkinson's disease diagnosis, as usually they are non-distinguishable in the early stages
Similarities
Both are characterised by having parkinsonian features (tremor,
bradykinesia
,
rigidity
)
Both can involve visual hallucinations
Both have a similar aetiology, related to the intra-neuronal aggregation of alpha-synuclein proteins
Differences
Characterised by a triad of visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, and
parkinsonism
In Lewy-body dementia, the dementia usually occurs concomitantly with, or prior to, the development of parkinsonism (and must occur no later than a year after onset of motor symptoms)
Secondary parkinsonism
Classical parkinsonian features can be a result from a number of other conditions, as opposed to idiopathic Parkinson's disease
Most commonly, secondary parkinsonism can be caused by medications, usually medications which utilise dopaminergic receptor blockade (e.g. atypical antipsychotics), or vascular disease
Drug-induced parkinsonism
Anti-psychotics and anti-emetic drugs which act via dopaminergic antagonism are those most implicated
Can be distinguished via a thorough medication history
Other movement disorders also caused by these drugs can help differentiate, such as akathisia, tardive dyskinesia and acute dystonia
Usually causes symmetrical symptoms
Vascular parkinsonism
Due to multiple infarcts affecting the basal ganglia
Usually can be identified via a thorough history and radiological findings
Probably step-wise progression rather than continuous
Improve
Management
There are a number of available treatments to help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however unfortunately none are curative and it is a progressive condition. When first suspected by any medical professional, the NICE guidelines recommend that a person should be referred quickly and
untreated
to a specialist with Parkinson's disease expertise first for assessment.
Available medications
Levodopa
Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine which is converted both in the CNS and periphery
Frequently dosed with carbidopa, a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor, to reduce the amount that is converted in the periphery, thus increasing the amount available in the CNS and reducing peripheral side effects
Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors
Commonly used medications are rasagiline and selegiline
These are inhibitors of MAO-B, which are responsible for degrading dopamine, therefore increasing the amount of dopamine available
Dopamine agonists
Mimic dopamine and bind to dopamine receptors to exert their effect
Non-ergot (e.g. ropinirole, pramipexole)
Ergot-derived dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine, cabergoline)
Recommendations for medical treatment
As per the NICE guidelines, the first-line treatment for early stage disease depends on the impact of the motor symptoms on the patient's quality of life
If motor symptoms impact on quality of life - levodopa
If motor symptoms do not impact on quality of life - dopamine agonist, levodopa or MAO-B inhibitors
As explained by the NICE guidelines and UptoDate, the choice between a dopamine agonist, levodopa or MAO-B inhibitors should be based on a number of patient specific factors, including:
The patient's current symptom profile
Patient age (UptoDate indicate that for patients over 65-years-old, levodopa is better tolerated than dopamine agonists)
Current co-morbidities and existing medications (need to consider the risk of polypharmacy and medication interactions)
Possible risks and side effects of each medication, taking into account patient preference
Over time, there is a potential for the effect of current medications to decrease, as well as worsening in symptoms due to the chronic progression of neurodegeneration
In there situations, if a patient is on sole levodopa therapy, the NICE guidelines recommend adding either a dopamine agonist, MAO-B inhibitor or catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors as adjunctive therapy
According to the NICE guidelines, ergot-derived dopamine agonists should not be used first line, only if required as an adjunct or alternative after failure of initial therapy
Deep brain stimulation
The NICE guidelines and BMJ best practice recommend using deep brain stimulation for people whose symptoms are
not
adequately controlled by medical therapy
This should
never
be used as first-line treatment
Involves applying an intermittent direct electrical current to the selected area
The two primary cortical structures to be targeted are the globus pallidus interna and the subthalamic nucleus
This procedure aims to correct the imbalance created by reduced function of the substantia nigra, to improve the symptoms for patients
The evidence suggests that this procedure improves motor function and movement abnormalities, however poses a risk of strokes, confusion and speech dysfunction
Adjuvant therapy
Physiotherapy
Specialist physiotherapy by a therapist who is experienced in Parkinson's disease may provide techniques to improve mobility and balance
Important for falls reduction as well as improvement in quality of life
Speech therapy
A speech therapist may be required for patients experiencing worsening dysarthria or dysphagia complications
Is particularly pertinent for patients with dysphagia to reduce the risk of aspiration
Occupational therapy
The NICE guidelines recommend referral for occupational therapy for patients whom are having difficulty and requiring assistance for activities of daily living (e.g. showering, dressing, cooking, gardening)
Improve
Complications
Autonomic dysfunction
This occurs when the autonomic nervous system fails to work appropriately, leading to abnormalities in the control of normal bodily homeostasis
This can be a complication of progressive Parkinson's disease, however can also be present in
multiple system atrophy
mistakenly diagnosed as Parkinson's disease and therefore this must be considered
Postural hypotension
is one of the most common manifestations, with no compensatory tachycardia due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system
Contributes to dizziness, light-headedness and subsequent falls
Constipation is also common due to dysregulated colonic smooth muscle activity
Urinary dysfunction, notably increased urinary frequency and urgency
May lead to urge incontinence due to involuntary detrusor muscle activity
Recurrent falls
Patients with Parkinson's disease are at a significantly raised risk of falls due to the significant motor symptoms (particularly due to postural instability and impaired corrective reflexes)
Approximately 2-fold greater risk of falls compared to comparable peers without Parkinson's disease, with approximately 60% reporting at least one fall
Can lead to subsequent fractures, hospitalisation and sometimes wheelchair confinement due to concern regarding further falls
Also contributed to by orthostatic hypotension from autonomic dysregulation
Cognitive impairment
Dementia has been reported to affect over 40% of people with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the later stages of the disease, typically subcortical
The diagnosis can be complicated depending on what stage the dementia begins in the course of the disease
If dementia develops >1 year after Parkinson's disease diagnosis, it is considered to be Parkinson's disease dementia
However, if dementia begins prior or alongside the Parkinson's disease diagnosis (<1 year), Lewy-body dementia is more likely
If identified early, cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine or donepezil can confer some benefit
Improve
Prognosis
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a variable prognosis, with patient outcomes influenced by multiple factors. Although PD typically shortens life expectancy, the progression of symptoms is highly variable, making it challenging to predict the future course for any given individual at the time of diagnosis.
Key Prognostic Factors
Age at Onset: Early-onset PD (diagnosis before age 50) generally progresses more slowly than late-onset PD.
Symptom Presentation: Patients presenting predominantly with tremor tend to experience slower progression compared to those whose initial symptoms are
rigidity
and
bradykinesia
.
Cognitive Status: Cognitive impairment or dementia at diagnosis is associated with faster disease progression and reduced survival.
Comorbidities: The presence of comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or pulmonary diseases can negatively impact prognosis.
Motor Complications
Early Response to Treatment: Motor symptoms are often highly responsive to dopaminergic therapies early in the disease course.
Motor Fluctuations: Motor fluctuations and "wearing off" develop in 30 to 40 percent of patients by five years and up to 60 percent by ten years.
Progression of Disability
A transition from disease impairment to disability (loss of independent function) typically occurs between three and seven years after diagnosis.
In a longitudinal study of 142 patients followed from 2000 to 2012, about 77 percent had a poor outcome (death, dementia, or postural instability) ten years post-diagnosis.
A minority of patients exhibit a particularly slow disease progression, maintaining balance and postural stability for over 10 years and avoiding severe disability even after 20 years.
Life Expectancy
Most studies suggest that mortality is modestly increased for patients with PD compared to age-matched controls, with a pooled mortality ratio of 1.5.
Median survival from diagnosis ranges from 6 to 22 years.
Increased age and the presence of dementia are associated with a higher risk of mortality.
Complications and Mortality
While PD itself is not a direct cause of death, complications from advanced stages—such as pneumonia due to dysphagia or falls resulting in fractures—contribute significantly to mortality.
Management and Quality of Life
The primary treatment goal for PD is symptom management to improve quality of life, given its chronic and progressive nature.
Regular monitoring and timely adjustments in therapeutic strategies are essential for effective management of the condition.
