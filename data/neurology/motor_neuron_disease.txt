Motor neuron disease
Motor neuron disease
Motor neuron disease is a neurological condition of unknown cause which can present with both upper and lower motor neuron signs. It rarely presents before 40 years and various patterns of disease are recognised including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy and bulbar palsy.

Clinical features
There are a number of clues which point towards a diagnosis of motor neuron disease:
fasciculations
the absence of sensory signs/symptoms*
the
mixture of lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron signs
wasting of the small hand muscles/tibialis anterior is common
Other features
doesn't affect external ocular muscles
no cerebellar signs
abdominal reflexes are usually preserved and sphincter dysfunction if present is a late feature
*vague sensory symptoms may occur early in the disease (e.g. limb pain) but 'never' sensory signs

Investigations
The diagnosis of motor neuron disease is clinical, but nerve conduction studies will show
normal motor conduction
and can help exclude a neuropathy. Electromyography shows a reduced number of action potentials with increased amplitude. MRI is usually performed to exclude the differential diagnosis of cervical cord compression and myelopathy

Riluzole
prevents stimulation of glutamate receptors
used mainly in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
prolongs life by about 3 months
Respiratory care
non-invasive ventilation (usually BIPAP) is used at night
studies have shown a survival benefit of around 7 months

Prognosis
Prognosis
poor: 50% of patients die within 3 years
