Holmes-Adie pupil
Holmes-Adie pupil
Holmes-Adie pupil is a neurological condition characterized by an enlarged pupil that reacts slowly to light and near stimuli. The condition is more common in women and typically affects individuals between the ages of 20 and 40 years. The exact cause of Holmes-Adie pupil is unknown, but it is believed to be related to damage or degeneration of the ciliary ganglion or its nerve supply.
Patients with Holmes-Adie pupil may experience blurred vision, difficulty focusing on near objects, and decreased depth perception. Diagnosis is made through a comprehensive eye exam, including pupillary testing and imaging studies. Treatment is typically not necessary, as the condition is usually benign and does not progress. However, patients may benefit from corrective lenses or prism glasses to improve visual acuity and reduce symptoms.

Pathophysiology
The underlying pathophysiology involves the damage to the ciliary ganglion postganglionic parasympathetic fibers responsible for pupillary constriction and accommodation.

Clinical features
Anisocoria:
Patients with Holmes-Adie pupil commonly present with anisocoria, i.e., unequal size of pupils. The affected pupil appears dilated in comparison to the contralateral side.
Tonic Pupillary Response:
The hallmark feature of this condition is the tonic response observed upon direct light stimulation. When exposed to light, the affected pupil demonstrates slow and prolonged constriction followed by gradual redilation. This sluggish reaction is best appreciated when comparing it to the normal brisk constriction of the unaffected side.
Light-Near Dissociation:
Another characteristic feature is light-near dissociation, where there is a reduced or absent pupillary reaction to light while maintaining a relatively preserved response to near stimulus (accommodation). This phenomenon occurs due to the selective involvement of parasympathetic fibres innervating the iris sphincter muscle.
Vermiform Movements:
Upon close examination of the affected iris under slit-lamp biomicroscopy, one may observe irregular, undulating movements known as vermiform movements. These subtle movements are attributed to segmental denervation and reinnervation of iris sphincter muscle fibres.
Accommodative Dysfunction:
Patients may report difficulty focusing on near objects or experience blurred vision at near distances due to impaired accommodation reflex.
Associated Neurological Findings:
Holmes-Adie syndrome, a variant of this condition, is characterized by the presence of additional neurological findings such as areflexia or hyporeflexia, particularly in the lower extremities. This manifestation results from damage to the peripheral nerve fibres that supply the muscle spindle stretch receptors.
