Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is rapidly progressive neurological condition caused by prion proteins. These proteins induce the formation of amyloid folds resulting in tightly packed beta-pleated sheets resistant to proteases.

Classification
Sporadic CJD
accounts for 85% of cases
10-15% of cases are familial
mean age of onset is 65 years
New variant CJD
younger patients (average age of onset = 25 years)
psychological symptoms such as anxiety, withdrawal and dysphonia are the most common presenting features
the 'prion protein' is encoded on chromosome 20 - it's role is not yet understood
methionine homozygosity at codon 129 of the prion protein is a risk factor for developing CJD - all patients who have so far died have had this
median survival = 13 months
Other prion diseases

fatal familial
insomnia

Clinical features
Typical Presentation
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) typically presents as a rapidly progressive dementia with neurological deterioration, with most patients progressing from first symptoms to death within 4-6 months
The clinical presentation varies depending on the CJD subtype (sporadic, variant, familial, or iatrogenic)
Sporadic CJD typically presents in older adults (mean age 65) with rapidly progressive cognitive decline and
myoclonus
Variant CJD (vCJD) typically affects younger individuals (mean age 25-30) and often begins with psychiatric and sensory symptoms
Common Clinical Features
Cognitive impairment
Rapidly progressive dementia is the hallmark feature
Memory loss, confusion, and disorientation
Language difficulties including dysphasia and mutism in later stages
Movement disorders
Myoclonus (sudden, brief, involuntary jerking movements) is present in approximately 90% of cases
Ataxia and gait disturbances
Pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs (rigidity, spasticity)
Visual disturbances
Visual hallucinations
Cortical blindness
Oculomotor abnormalities
Psychiatric symptoms
Depression
, anxiety, apathy
Behavioural changes and personality alterations
Psychosis (more common in vCJD)
Terminal stage
Akinetic mutism (awake but unresponsive)
Loss of voluntary movements
Autonomic dysfunction
Variant CJD-Specific Features
Psychiatric symptoms often predominate early in vCJD, including depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and behavioural changes
Persistent painful sensory symptoms (paraesthesia, dysaesthesia)
Later development of cerebellar ataxia, dementia and involuntary movements
More prolonged clinical course (median 13-14 months) compared to sporadic CJD
The "pulvinar sign" on MRI (bilateral high signal in the posterior thalamus) is highly characteristic
NICE CJD Guideline [NG200] notes that "healthcare professionals should be aware that CJD is a rare but important differential diagnosis in people with rapidly progressive neurological symptoms, particularly when associated with psychiatric symptoms, sensory symptoms including pain, visual symptoms, or ataxia."

Investigations
The diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is primarily clinical, supported by characteristic findings on investigations.
No single test is diagnostic for CJD, and a combination of investigations is typically required.
First-line investigations should include:
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain
Electroencephalography (EEG)
Exclusion of treatable causes of rapidly progressive dementia
CSF Analysis
CSF is typically acellular with normal or mildly raised protein
Absence of pleocytosis helps distinguish CJD from encephalitis
CSF Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay is highly specific (99%) and sensitive (92%) for CJD
RT-QuIC detects the presence of abnormal prion proteins
The National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit recommends RT-QuIC as the preferred diagnostic test for sporadic CJD
Traditional CSF biomarkers include:
14-3-3 protein (elevated in CJD but lacks specificity)
S100B protein
Tau protein
These have been largely superseded by RT-QuIC testing
Neuroimaging
MRI is the imaging modality of choice
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences are most sensitive for CJD-related changes
Characteristic findings include:
Hyperintensity in the basal ganglia (particularly caudate and putamen)
Cortical ribboning (hyperintensity along the cerebral cortex)
Thalamic hyperintensity (particularly in variant CJD - "pulvinar sign")
FLAIR sequences may show similar but less sensitive changes
CT brain has limited value but may be used to exclude other pathologies
Electroencephalography
EEG has moderate sensitivity and specificity for CJD
Classical finding is generalised periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs)
PSWCs typically appear in the middle and late stages of disease
Absent in approximately 30% of sporadic CJD cases
Rarely seen in variant CJD
Serial EEGs may be required as abnormalities can evolve over time
In cases where diagnosis remains uncertain:
Brain biopsy may be considered, though rarely performed ante-mortem
Genetic testing for PRNP mutations in suspected familial cases
The National Prion Clinic and National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit should be consulted for guidance on complex cases
