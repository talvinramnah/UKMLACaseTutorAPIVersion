Friedreich's ataxia
Friedreich's ataxia
Friedreich's ataxia is the most common of the early-onset hereditary ataxias. It is an autosomal recessive, trinucleotide repeat disorder characterised by a GAA repeat in the X25 gene on chromosome 9 (frataxin). Friedreich's ataxia is unusual amongst trinucleotide repeat disorders in not demonstrating the phenomenon of anticipation.

Differential diagnosis
Comparison of Friedreich's ataxia and ataxic telangiectasia. Note in particular how ataxic telangiectasia tends to present much earlier, often at the age of 1-2 years
