Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord
Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCD) is a rare neurological disorder that affects the dorsal columns, lateral corticospinal tracts and spinocerebellar tracts of the spinal cord. It is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, which can occur due to malabsorption, inadequate dietary intake, or other underlying medical conditions. SCD typically presents with a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, tingling, and difficulty walking. These symptoms may progress over time and can lead to permanent neurological damage if left untreated.
Treatment involves high-dose vitamin B12 supplementation, which can help to reverse the neurological symptoms and prevent further damage. However, in some cases, the neurological deficits may be irreversible even with treatment.
