Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease, clinically defined by two episodes of neurological dysfunction (brain, spinal cord or optic nerves) separated in space and time. Thought to be an autoimmune disease and multifactorial origin, MS is the most common cause of neurological disability in those younger than 40 years old and affects ~ 190 per 100,000 population. The female to male ratio is around 3:1 with increasing frequency of MS in women, which suggests an environmental factor working in a sex-specific manner.

Aetiology
The underlying cause for this autoimmune response appears to be multifactorial in nature, associated with environmental factors in those with genetic susceptibility:
Genetics
15-20% of MS patients report a family history of the disease
Concordance rate in monozygotic twins is ~ 25% and dizygotic/1st degree relatives are 2-5%
Genes in the HLA and IL region have been implicated
Environmental
EBV
People with EBV antibody-positive serology have a 5.5 times greater risk of MS than those without
Hypothesised that primary EBV infection increases blood-brain barrier permeability to lymphocytes
Smoking
Increased odds or rate ratio of 1.22 to 1.51 of MS in smokers
Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide can cause neuronal damage
Vitamin D
A prospective case-control study of 7 million military personnel found the risk of MS decreased with higher Vitamin D levels
Role in gene expression and immunity regulation
Latitude
The prevalence of MS appears to increase with higher geographic latitudes
Also associated with earlier onset of MS
This appears to be linked with exposure to sunlight (and therefore vitamin D)
Pregnancy
Since MS has a higher predilection in females of childbearing age, knowledge of managing MS in pregnancy is important to prevent delay of treatment and safety to mother and baby
In 2018 Association of British Neurologists devised a consensus on pregnancy in MS. In summary:
Prepregnancy counselling should inform women who have MS to involve their MS specialist
MS does not affect conception or increase the risk of miscarriage
Treatment should not be deferred because they wish to have children in the future
Having MS does not necessarily make a pregnancy high risk and should not limit birthing options
During pregnancy many find their symptoms improve and experience fewer relapses. However, ~25% of women will relapse within 3 months postpartum
If a relapse occurs women should be treated with corticosteroids
MRI is not contraindicated in pregnancy,
however
Gd contrast should be avoided
1st line therapies for MS in pregnancy include interferon beta or glatiramer acetate
Improve
Pathophysiology
The exact pathogenesis of MS is still unknown, however it is thought to be an autoimmune mediated (mostly T cell activated) response, that results in 2 distinct phases:
Inflammatory
T-lymphocyte activation and interaction with CNS endothelial cells, leading to inflammatory cytokine and macrophage induced demyelination
Degenerative
Demyelination leads to affects axonal support and membrane potentials
Eventual degeneration and loss over time
Histopathologically MS is characterised by:
Multifocal demyelination
Loss of oligodendroctyes
Astrogliosis and loss of axons in mostly white matter
Improve
Classification
In 2014, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS in collaboration with the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRMS) and National MS Society, redefined the original clinical phenotypes first set out in 1996. Clinical descriptive terminology in relation to MS was further defined:
Dissemination in space (DIS)
Development of lesions in different anatomical locations within the CNS
Demonstrated on MRI by
â‰¥1 T2 hyperintense lesion characteristic of MS
In 2 or more of: periventricular, cortical or juxtacortical and infratentorial brain regions or the spinal cord
Dissemination in time (DIT)
Development of new CNS lesions appearing over time
Demonstrated on MRI by
Simultaneous gadolinium (Gd) enhancing and non enhancing lesions at any time
or
New T2 hyperintense or Gd enhancing lesions compared to a baseline MRI
Relapse
Reported symptoms or objective findings suggestive of focal or multifocal MS pathology
Lasting at least 24 hours
Developed acutely or subacutely
With or without recovery
In the absence of fever or infection
Preceded by a stable neurological state of at least 30 days.
Attack, exacerbation
and (when it is the first episode)
clinically isolated syndrome
are synonyms
Active
Clinical relapses and/or radiological evidence of new lesions on MRI
Progressive
An MS course characterised by steadily worsening neurological disability (objectively documented)
Stability and superimposed relapses can occur
Can be further classified as
primary progressive
or
secondary progressive
(see below)
Worsening disease
Increase in neurological disability secondary to relapses and/or progressive disease
The 3 main patterns of the disease are based on disease activity and progression:
Relapsing-remitting
MS (RRMS) (~85% of cases):
Relapses are followed by periods of neurological stability between episodes.
Relapse symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to months, however, they usually resolve after 4-6 weeks.
Periods of stability can then occur for months, even years before another relapse
Multiple relapses can result in irreversible CNS damage leading to partial recovery during remissions
Secondary progressive
MS (SPMS):
A progressive neurological disability after an initial RRMS course.
~50% of RRMS progress to SPMS within 15 years of disease onset
~66% by 30 years of disease onset
Primary progressive
MS (PPMS) (~10-15% of cases):
Steady progressive worsening of neurological symptoms from onset
Clinically isolated syndrome
(CIS):
A separate entity to MS, but can subsequently lead to a diagnosis of the condition
This is similar to relapse, but in a patient
not known
to have MS
Typical presentation include optic neuritis, focal supratentorial, brainstem or cerebellar syndrome
If the patient is subsequently diagnosed with MS, the CIS is defined as their first attack
Improve
Clinical features
Since MS affects the CNS, its presentation of symptoms and signs can differ greatly between individuals day to day.
Some of the most common symptoms are:
Vision problems (~85%)
Around 1 in 4 cases of MS present with optic neuritis
This can present as temporary vision loss (including a scotoma), colour blindness and painful eye movements
Examination may reveal internuclear ophthalmoplegia or a pale optic disc on fundoscopy
Fatigue
(~80%)
Exhaustion disproportionate to the activity being carried out
Causes of fatigue are in MS are thought to be due to the disease process (primary) and as a consequence of living with it (secondary) e.g. pain affecting sleep
Pain (neuropathic and nociceptive) and
altered sensation
(~80%)
Trigeminal neuralgia
Optic neuritis
Chest tightness (or banding)
Lhermitte's phenomenon
A shock-like sensation radiating down the spine induced by neck flexion)
Muscle spasticity, stiffness and weakness (~80%)
Spasticity usually affects legs more than arms.
Can be associated with spasms that may disturb sleep and lead to falls and issues with mobility
Weakness usually affects both lower limbs>one lower limb>upper and lower limb same side>an upper limb
Mobility issues (~75%)
Demyelination of cerebellar pathways can lead to ataxia
Upper limb intention tremor is common due to thalamus and basal ganglia involvement
Bladder and bowel dysfunction (~75-90%)
Increased frequency and urgency
Urinary retention
Recurrent UTIs
Constipation is the most common bowel complaint
Sexual dysfunction (40-90%)
Erectile dysfunction is the most common complaint in men
Loss of libido and anorgasmia have been documented in both sexes
Depression and anxiety (~40-60%)
Most common mood disorder in MS
No clear correlation with severity, type of MS or symptom duration
Often associated with cognitive impairment, fatigue and pain
Cognitive impairment (~43%)
Problems with learning and short term memory common
Executive functions (e.g. problem solving and planning) affected
Speech and swallowing issues (~40%)
Bulbar muscle problems causing dysarthria or dysphagia
Improve
Investigations
The
2019 NICE Guidelines
recommend the following 1st line blood tests in those suspected of MS prior to referring to
neurology
:
FBC
Rule out evidence of anaemia (macrocytic in B12 deficiency) and malignancy (thrombocytopenia in lymphoma)
Inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and ESR)
Elevated in infections of the CNS or vasculitides
LFTs
Chronic liver disease can cause polyneuropathy and hepatic encephalopathy
U&Es
Calcium
Hypocalcaemia classically presents with
paraesthesia
and tetany
Glucose
Peripheral neuropathy secondary to poor diabetic control
TFTs
Hypothyroidism can present with
fatigue
, muscle weakness, constipation, slowed movement and thought processing
Vitamin B12
Severe deficiency leading to subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord
HIV serology
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy due to reactivation of the JC virus
Lesions occur anywhere in the CNS mimicking MS
In the absence of abnormal blood tests and high clinical suspicion of MS, referral to a consultant neurologist is recommended.
Investigations carried out in secondary care to confirm diagnosis of MS as recommended in the
2017 McDonald Criteria
include:
MRI brain in all suspected MS patients
MRI spine if:
Suggestion of spinal cord lesion
Primary progressive pattern
MS in atypical demographic
To confirm diagnostic confidence of MRI brain
CSF examination recommended when:
Insufficient clinical of MRI evidence to diagnose MS
Any presentation other than CIS
Atypical clinical, imaging or lab findings of MS
MS in atypical demographic
Improve
Diagnosis
The McDonald criteria devised in 2001, has undergone a number iterations, most recently revised in 2017 by the International Panel on Diagnosis of MS. This combines clinical, radiological and lab-based findings for diagnosis.
Their position paper describes the following diagnostic criteria for MS:
Clinical Presentation
Additional Data Needed for Diagnosis
â‰¥ 2 clinical attacks and objective clinical evidence of â‰¥ 2 lesions
None
â‰¥ 2 clinical attacks and objective clinical evidence of 1 lesion
DIS: a further attack indicating a different CNS site
or
by MRI
1 clinical attack
and
objective clinical evidence of â‰¥ 2 lesions
DIT: a further attack or by MRI
OR
CSF-specific oligoclonal bands
1 attack and objective clinical evidence of 1 lesion
DIS: a further attack indicating a different CNS site or by MRI
OR
DIT: further clinical attack or by MRI
OR
CSF-specific oligoclonal bands
Specifically when assigning a specific MS clinical phenotype the following diagnostic criteria apply:
RRMS
Requires evidence of:
Dissemination in space on MRI
Gadolinium enhancing and hypointense T2 lesions and/or
Subsequent clinical or radiological relapse
PPMS
â‰¥ 1 year of disability progression (determined prospectively or retrospectively) irrespective of relapses
With two of the following:
â‰¥1 T2 hyperintense lesions characteristic of MS in one or more of the following regions: periventricular, cortical or juxtacortical, or infratentorial
â‰¥2 T2 hyperintense spinal cord lesions
Presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands
SPMS
Currently, there are no clearly defined clinical, imaging or biochemical diagnostic criteria that define SPMS
Diagnosis is frequently retrospective
A definition based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is currently being explored
Improve

Management
Treatment in multiple sclerosis is focused on reducing the frequency and duration of relapses. There is no cure.
Acute relapse
High-dose steroids (e.g. oral or IV methylprednisolone) may be given for 5 days to shorten the length of an acute relapse. It should be noted that steroids shorten the duration of a relapse and do not alter the degree of recovery (i.e. whether a patient returns to baseline function)
Disease modifying drugs
A number of drugs have been shown to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with MS. Typical indications for disease-modifying drugs include:
relapsing-remitting disease + 2 relapses in past 2 years + able to walk 100m unaided
secondary progressive disease + 2 relapses in past 2 years + able to walk 10m (aided or unaided)
Drug options for reducing the risk of relapse in MS
natalizumab
a recombinant monoclonal antibody that antagonises alpha-4 beta-1-integrin found on the surface of leucocytes
inhibit migration of leucocytes across the endothelium across the blood-brain barrier
generally considered to have the strongest evidence base for preventing relapse of the disease-modifying and hence is often used first-line
given intravenously
ocrelizumab
humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
like natalizumab, it is considered a high-efficacy drug that is often used first-line
given intravenously
fingolimod
sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator
prevents lymphocytes from leaving lymph nodes
oral formulations are available
beta-interferon
not considered to be as effective as alternative disease-modifying drugs
given subcutaneously/intramuscularly
glatiramer acetate
immunomodulating drug - acts as an 'immune decoy'
given subcutaneously
along with beta-interferon considered an 'older drug' with less effectiveness compared to monoclonal antibodies and S1P) receptor modulators
Some specific problems
Fatigue
once other problems (e.g. anaemia, thyroid or depression) have been excluded NICE recommend a trial of amantadine
other options include mindfulness training and CBT
Spasticity
baclofen and gabapentin are first-line. Other options include diazepam, dantrolene and tizanidine
physiotherapy is important
cannabis and botox are undergoing evaluation
Bladder dysfunction
may take the form of urgency, incontinence, overflow etc
guidelines stress the importance of getting an ultrasound first to assess bladder emptying - anticholinergics may worsen symptoms in some patients
if significant residual volume â†’ intermittent self-catheterisation
if no significant residual volume â†’ anticholinergics may improve urinary frequency
Oscillopsia (visual fields appear to oscillate)
gabapentin is first-line
Improve
Complications
Multiple sclerosis (MS) can lead to numerous complications, both as direct consequences of the disease process and indirect results from mobility or lifestyle changes. Understanding these complications is essential for comprehensive patient management.
Neurological Complications
Spasticity:
This is a common complication in MS patients, manifesting as muscle stiffness and spasms, particularly in lower extremities. It can significantly impair mobility and quality of life.
Fatigue
:
Up to 80% of individuals with MS experience fatigue, which can be debilitating and significantly interfere with daily activities.
Cognitive Impairment:
Cognitive dysfunction affects approximately 40-60% of MS patients, impacting memory, attention, information processing speed, and executive functioning.
Dysphagia:
Difficulty swallowing may occur in later stages of MS due to neurological impairment. This increases the risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Mental Health Complications
Depression:
Depression rates are high among people with MS. It can result from the psychological stress of living with a chronic illness or as a direct effect of MS on mood-regulating regions in the brain.
Anxiety Disorders:
These are also prevalent among individuals with MS and may coexist with depression.
Skeletal/Muscular Complications
Osteoporosis:
Reduced mobility or steroid use may lead to accelerated bone loss and increased fracture risk in individuals with MS.
Vascular Complications
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE):
Immobility due to advanced disease raises the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
Bladder, Bowel and Sexual Dysfunction
Bladder Dysfunction:
Neurogenic bladder is common in MS, leading to symptoms such as urgency, frequency, incontinence or urinary retention.
Bowel Dysfunction:
Constipation and faecal incontinence can occur due to disrupted neurological control of bowel function.
Sexual Dysfunction:
Both men and women with MS may experience sexual dysfunction due to neurological impairment or psychological factors.
The management of these complications often requires a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, dieticians and other healthcare professionals. Early identification and proactive management can help mitigate their impact on patients' quality of life.
Improve
Prognosis
It is difficult to prognosticate in MS patients as some may follow a very benign course whilst others will develop rapid onset disability within years of diagnosis. This can be influenced by:
MS phenotype
A study of 220 MS patients, showed after 15 years: RRMS patients had a survival rate of ~95% (PPMS, ~90%), those without a wheelchair (EDSS <7.0) ~84% (PPMS, ~42%) and ~71% (PPMS, ~9%) walking without an aid.
Severity and frequency of relapses
RRMS prognosis more favourable in those with less frequent initial relapses and if there is more than 2-3 years between 1st and 2nd relapse.
Newer studies show higher lesion burden at onset=poorer prognosis.
Responsiveness to treatment
Steroids reduces length and severity of relapse, but no long term effect on disease course or prognosis.
DMTs may reduce the number and severity of relapses.
A 2013 Cochrane review found they can prevent disability progression, but longer-term studies needed.
