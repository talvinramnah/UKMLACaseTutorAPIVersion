Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by
excessive daytime sleepiness
, cataplexy, hypnagogic
hallucinations
, and sleep paralysis. It is caused by the loss of hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus, which regulate wakefulness and sleep. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on clinical symptoms, polysomnography, and multiple sleep latency testing. Treatment options include stimulants to improve wakefulness, antidepressants to reduce cataplexy and other symptoms, and sodium oxybate to improve nighttime sleep and reduce daytime sleepiness. Patients with narcolepsy are at increased risk for accidents, depression, and social isolation, and may require accommodations in school or work settings.

Clinical features
The clinical features of narcolepsy can be broadly divided into two subtypes: narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2.
Excessive daytime sleepiness
Excessive daytime sleepiness is a hallmark symptom experienced by patients with both narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2. It is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to sleep during the day, resulting in sudden and involuntary episodes of sleep known as 'sleep attacks.' These episodes often last for several minutes to an hour and occur irrespective of the amount or quality of nighttime sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness may lead to impaired cognitive function, reduced alertness, and difficulty concentrating, which can negatively impact daily activities and work performance.
Cataplexy
Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger, or surprise, leading to partial or complete collapse without
loss of consciousness
. This symptom is more commonly associated with narcolepsy type 1; however, it can also be present in some cases of narcolepsy type 2. Cataplexy episodes typically last from a few seconds to several minutes and can vary in severity from mild weakness in specific muscle groups (e.g., facial muscles) to complete body paralysis.
Sleep paralysis
Sleep paralysis refers to the transient inability to move or speak upon awakening from sleep or while falling asleep. Patients with narcolepsy may experience this phenomenon more frequently than the general population. Sleep paralysis episodes usually last for a few seconds to minutes and can be accompanied by vivid
hallucinations
, heightened anxiety, and fear.
Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations
Hypnagogic hallucinations occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, while hypnopompic hallucinations take place upon awakening from sleep. These vivid and often frightening sensory experiences may involve visual, auditory, or tactile sensations and are frequently reported by patients with narcolepsy.
