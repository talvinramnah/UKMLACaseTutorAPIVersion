Brachial neuritis
Brachial neuritis
Brachial neuritis, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome, is a rare condition that affects the brachial plexus nerves in the shoulder and upper arm. It typically presents with sudden onset severe pain followed by weakness and atrophy of the affected muscles. The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an autoimmune response triggered by infection or trauma.
Diagnosis is made through a combination of clinical examination, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies. Treatment is primarily supportive, with pain management and physical therapy to maintain range of motion and prevent muscle atrophy. Recovery can take several months to years, and some patients may experience residual weakness or chronic pain.

Clinical features
The hallmark feature of brachial neuritis is
acute, severe pain in the shoulder region
. The pain typically has a sudden onset and may be preceded by an antecedent event such as infection, surgery, or trauma; however, many cases have no identifiable precipitating factor. The pain is often described as sharp or burning in nature and may radiate along the course of affected nerves. Patients frequently report exacerbation of pain with movement or palpation of the involved muscles.
Following the initial phase of intense pain, which can last from hours to weeks,
patients may experience progressive weakness and atrophy
in one or more muscles innervated by the brachial plexus. The distribution of muscle involvement varies but commonly includes the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, serratus anterior, deltoid, biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles.
Sensory disturbances are less common but can manifest as numbness, tingling (paresthesia), or altered sensation (dysesthesia) in areas corresponding to affected nerves. In some cases, patients may develop autonomic dysfunction leading to vasomotor changes such as localized oedema or temperature alterations.
On physical examination, patients with brachial neuritis may exhibit muscle weakness, atrophy, or fasciculations in the affected muscles. Range of motion may be limited due to pain and muscle dysfunction. Sensory deficits, if present, should be mapped to specific dermatomes to help localize the involved nerves.
Reflexes may be diminished or absent in the affected extremity. In severe cases, patients may develop scapular winging secondary to serratus anterior muscle weakness or shoulder droop due to trapezius and levator scapulae involvement.
A thorough examination of the cervical spine, shoulder joint, and peripheral nerves is essential to differentiate brachial neuritis from other conditions that can cause similar symptoms such as cervical radiculopathy, rotator cuff pathology, or peripheral neuropathies.
