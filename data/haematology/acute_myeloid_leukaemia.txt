Acute myeloid leukaemia
Acute myeloid leukaemia
Acute myeloid
leukaemia
or acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) is a malignant disease of the bone marrow that arises from myeloid cell lines. The immature cells, arrested in early stages of development, are released into the blood and impair normal haematopoiesis causing
anaemia
, bleeding, and infections. It is the most common form of acute leukaemia in adults with the median age at diagnosis of 65 years. AML is associated with environmental factors, pre-existing haematological disorders, and genetic abnormalities. Bone marrow biopsy is required for diagnosis. Patients are treated with chemotherapy or haematopoietic cell transplantation. Most patients achieve remission, but relapse is common.

Aetiology
- Genetic Factors:
Chromosomal abnormalities such as translocations (e.g., t(8;21), t(15;17), and t(9;11))
Gene mutations impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis, including FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA
Environmental Exposures:
Previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, termed therapy-related AML
Exposure to benzene and other petrochemicals
Radiation exposure, notably ionising radiation
Haematological Disorders:
Antecedent haematologic disorders like myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms predisposing to secondary AML
Genetic Syndromes:
Conditions such as Down syndrome, Fanconi
anaemia
, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome associated with increased AML risk
Improve
Pathophysiology
AML arises due to the acquisition of genetic mutations in haematopoietic progenitor cells that disrupt normal cell proliferation and differentiation. This disruption results in the accumulation of immature cells, known as blasts, in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, leading to bone marrow failure.
First hit:
The pathogenesis of AML often begins with a 'first hit' mutation that confers a proliferative advantage to a haematopoietic stem cell. This leads to clonal expansion of this cell and its progeny. Common 'first hit' mutations occur in genes such as FLT3, NPM1, or DNMT3A.
Second hit:
A 'second hit' mutation subsequently occurs in one of the clonally expanded cells, affecting a gene involved in haematopoietic differentiation, such as RUNX1 or CEBPA. This 'second hit' mutation further promotes proliferation and blocks differentiation, leading to the accumulation of immature blasts.
Blast accumulation:
The accumulation of immature blasts in the bone marrow leads to bone marrow failure due to the suppression of normal haematopoiesis. This can present clinically as
anaemia
,
thrombocytopenia
, or neutropenia.
Invasion of other organs:
As the disease progresses, the leukaemic blasts can invade other organs, such as the spleen, liver, and central nervous system, leading to organomegaly and other clinical manifestations.

Classification
There are many classification systems. The World Health Organisation (WHO) classification is based upon a combination of morphology, immunophenotype, genetics, and clinical features. The French-American-British (FAB) classification is based upon the histopathological appearance of the cells. WHO classification scheme essentially replaced the FAB classification system.
Broadly, there are six groups of AML in WHO classification system:
AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities
AML with
myelodysplasia
-related features
Therapy-related AML and MDS
AML, not otherwise specified
Myeloid sarcoma
Myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome
There are eight subtypes of AML in FAB classification system:
M0: Acute myeloblastic
leukaemia
without maturation
M1: Acute myeloblastic leukaemia with minimal granulocyte maturation
M2: Acute myeloblastic leukaemia with granulocyte maturation
M3: Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)
M4: Acute myelomonocytic leukaemia
M5: Acute monocytic leukaemia
M6: Acute erythroid leukaemia
M7: Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia
Improve
Clinical features
The abnormal cells suppress normal haematopoiesis causing pancytopenia, which leads to
anaemia
, bleeding, and infections
, among other symptoms and signs. There is sudden onset of symptoms and it progresses rapidly. Some patients are asymptomatic and may only show laboratory abnormalities. The common symptoms and signs are:
Fever
:
Mostly due to infections but may occur solely due to
leukaemia
.
Immature leucocytes predisposes to frequent infections.
Anaemia:
Shortness of breath, palpitations.
Weakness,
fatigue
, dizziness.
Pallor
.
Thrombocytopenia
:
Ecchymoses or petechiae.
Gingival bleeding, epistaxis, or menorrhagia.
Coagulopathy:
Unique to acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Bleeding secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Medical emergency.
Bone pain
:
Sternal discomfort or aching in extremities.
Due to expansion of the medullary cavity by the leukemic process.
Leukaemia cutis:
Nodular, violaceous lesions on the skin.
Seen in up to 13% of patients.
Mostly associated with acute monocytic leukaemia or acute myelomonocytic leukaemia.
Gingival hypertrophy:
Primarily associated with the monocytic subtype.
Infiltration by leukaemic cells.
CNS involvement:
Headache, visual changes, and nerve palsies.
Mostly associated with acute monocytic leukaemia or acute .myelomonocytic leukaemia
Organomegaly:
Adenopathy, hepatomegaly, and
splenomegaly
.

Investigations
Patients with AML can show abnormal blood counts, metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities. The common studies are:
Full blood count with differential:
Normocytic, normochromic
anaemia
Thrombocytopenia
Leucocyte count: maybe low, normal, or raised.
Peripheral blood smear:
Raised myeloblasts: myeloblasts are immature cells with large nuclei, usually with prominent nucleoli, and pale blue cytoplasm with Wright Giemsa stain.
Auer rods:
Pink/red, rod-shaped cytoplasmic granular inclusions.
Myeloperoxidase positive.
Pathognomonic of myeloblasts.
Mostly seen with acute promyelocytic
leukaemia
.
Coagulation panel for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):
Raised prothrombin time (PT), raised activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), low platelet count, elevated D-dimer concentration and decreased fibrinogen concentration is seen in .
Serum electrolytes:
Electrolyte abnormalities are seen with increased cell lysis
Hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperuricemia
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy:
Confirmatory test of AML
â‰¥ 20% myeloblasts
in the bone marrow confirm the diagnosis
Immunophenotyping: the majority of subtypes are express CD13, CD33, CD34, CD117, and HLA-DR.
Cytogenetic features: cytogenetic abnormalities can be identified by conventional karyotypic analysis plus reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The abnormalities like: t (8;21)(q22;q22), inv (16)(p13;q22), t (16;16)(p13;q22), and t (15;17)(q22;q12), define AML irrespective of the blast count.
Molecular studies: abnormalities in specific genes FLT3, NPM1, KIT, CEBPA, IDH1 and IDH2, p53, or RUNX1.

Management
Untreated AML is a lethal and intensive treatment with chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Treatment depends on the type of AML, prognostic factors, and the individual patient's comorbid illnesses, age, and other factors. The goal of treatment is determined by the clinician and the patient, and depends on age of patient, medical fitness, personal preferences, and prognostic features. The goal for most patients is achievement of complete remission  (CR: <5% blast cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood). Management of complications and supportive management is essential.
Acute promyelocytic
leukaemia
(APL) is a distinct form of AML that represents a medical emergency. Treatment of APL differs significantly from that of other forms of AML. For APL,
all
-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
and arsenic are used to induce the maturation of immature malignant cells.
Chemotherapy
: the choice of drug is based on the cytogenetics. Cytarabine and anthracyclines (daunorubicin) are commonly used. Targeted agents like midostaurin, ivosidenib, or enasidenib may be added for specific mutations.
Induction chemotherapy:
Intensive combination chemotherapy.
To achieve complete remission.
Failure of relapse may warrant re-induction therapy.
Consolidation chemotherapy:
An intensive treatment that follows after complete remission.
To destroy remaining tumour cells
Maintenance chemotherapy:
Non-myelosuppressive treatment
To maintain remission
Haematopoietic cell transplantation
(HCT):
Indicated for patients with unfavourable prognostic factors (unfavourable cytogenetics) or patients who do not achieve remission through chemotherapy. Allogeneic HCT is preferred.
Monitoring and supportive treatment:
Preventing and treating infections:
Antibiotic prophylaxis (broad-spectrum IV antibiotics) for febrile neutropenia.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in neutropenic patients.
Immunisations
Maintain hygiene
Surveillance for infections.
Nutritional support
Antiemetics (ondansetron)
Transfusions for severe
anaemia
,
thrombocytopenia
.

Complications
Several complications can arise in AML due to high turnover of the leukemic cells or due to the initiation of chemotherapy. The complications are:
Tumour lysis syndrome
: An oncologic emergency. It mostly occurs after initiating cytotoxic therapy, although it may occur spontaneously. The rapid destruction of tumour cells leads to a massive release of intracellular components (potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acid) into the circulation.
Labs: hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia (secondary to phosphate binding), and hyperuricemia (nucleic acid conversion to uric acid).
Acute kidney injury (due to calcium phosphate crystals in tubules and urate nephropathy).
Clinical features:
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea,
Lethargy
Hematuria
Seizures, arrhythmias
Tetany, muscle cramps, paresthesia
Leukostasis
: excessive number of leukaemic cells (hyperleukocytosis: white blood cell count greater than 50 x 10
9
/ÂµL) causes increased blood viscosity. It typically presents with respiratory or neurological distress. The clinical features are:
Chest pain
Headache
Altered mental status
Priapism
Disseminated intravascular coagulation: although it may be seen with
all
subtypes of AML, it is especially associated with acute promyelocytic
leukaemia
.
Severe neutropenia: the absolute neutrophil count is <500 cells/ÂµL, and there is a high risk of infections.
Severe
thrombocytopenia
: counts less than 10,000/ÂµL or active bleeding.
Severe
anaemia
: normocytic, normochromic anaemia; a haemoglobin level Ã¢â‰¤8 g/dL needs a transfusion.
Venous thromboembolism: mostly occurs during the first three months of treatment.

myelodysplastic syndrome
or myeloproliferative neoplasm)
No antecedent history of exposure to cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy
Cytogenetic features:
MDR 1-negative phenotype
Translocations: t (8;21), inv (16), t (16;16), t (15;17)
