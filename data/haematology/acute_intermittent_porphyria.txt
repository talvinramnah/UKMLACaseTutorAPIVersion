Acute intermittent porphyria
Acute intermittent porphyria
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a rare autosomal dominant condition caused by a defect in porphobilinogen deaminase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of haem. The results in the toxic accumulation of delta aminolaevulinic acid and porphobilinogen. It characteristically presents with abdominal and neuropsychiatric symptoms in 20-40 year olds. AIP is more common in females (5:1)

Investigations
- classically urine turns deep red on standing
raised urinary porphobilinogen (elevated between attacks and to a greater extent during acute attacks)
assay of red cells for porphobilinogen deaminase
raised serum levels of delta aminolaevulinic acid and porphobilinogen
Improve
