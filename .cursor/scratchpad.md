# UKMLA Case Tutor API - Add Desired Specialty Field

## Background and Motivation
The user has added a `desired_specialty` column to the `user_metadata` table in Supabase and updated the frontend onboarding modal to capture this information. The backend onboarding endpoints need to be updated to accept and store this new field.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to update the `OnboardingRequest` Pydantic model to include the `desired_specialty` field
- Need to update the `/onboarding` endpoint to handle and store the new field
- Need to update the `/user_metadata/me` endpoint to return the new field
- Ensure proper validation for the specialty field

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Update `OnboardingRequest` model to include `desired_specialty` field
- [x] Update `/onboarding` endpoint to store `desired_specialty` in database
- [x] Update `/user_metadata/me` endpoint to return `desired_specialty` field
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure they work correctly

## Project Status Board
- [x] **Task 1**: Update OnboardingRequest Pydantic model ✅
- [x] **Task 2**: Update /onboarding endpoint database insertion ✅
- [x] **Task 3**: Update /user_metadata/me endpoint response ✅
- [ ] **Task 4**: Test the implementation
- [x] Fix CORS allow_origins list to include both https://bleep64.com and https://www.bleep64.com (missing comma bug)
- [ ] Redeploy/restart FastAPI server to apply CORS changes
- [x] Fix /continue_case streaming so 'is_completed' is only sent when the case is truly finished
- [x] Add condition_stats to /progress endpoint response

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Status: Streaming fix for 'is_completed' in /continue_case implemented
- Completed: Now, 'is_completed' is only included in the response when the case is truly finished (i.e., after '[CASE COMPLETED]' is detected in the final message). For all intermediate steps, it is omitted.
- Next: Test the streaming endpoint with a real case to ensure the frontend only shows feedback and post-case actions at the correct time.
- The /progress endpoint now includes a condition_stats field with per-condition total_cases and avg_score, as required by the frontend. Implementation used the already-fetched completed_cases list for efficient aggregation.
- Awaiting user confirmation after frontend testing.
- A development-friendly RLS policy has been added: all authenticated users can now read the performance table. This unblocks frontend testing and profile/progress page access. **Reminder:** Remove this policy before production for strong security.
- **Task 1:** `weekly_action_points` table created in Supabase (COMPLETE)
- **Task 2:** Utility function to enumerate all wards and conditions implemented in backend.
- **Task 3:** Weekly stats calculation utility implemented in backend.
- **Task 4:** Latest feedback report fetch utility implemented in backend.
- **Task 5:** Weekly action points generation/caching logic implemented in backend.
- **Task 6:** /weekly_dashboard_stats endpoint implemented in backend.
- **Task 7:** Backend-side testing complete. Results:
    - User with <10 cases: receives onboarding message and correct next_refresh_in_cases
    - User with >10 cases: receives 2 action points, correct pass/fail stats
    - User at milestone: action points refresh as expected
    - Error handling: invalid token returns 401, missing data handled gracefully
    - No major issues found; endpoint is ready for frontend integration.
- **Task 8:** API contract documented and frontend integration plan updated (COMPLETE)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Implementation Complete**: I have successfully updated the backend to handle the `desired_specialty` field:

1. **OnboardingRequest Model**: Added `desired_specialty: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)` to the Pydantic model
2. **Onboarding Endpoint**: Updated the database insertion to include `"desired_specialty": request.desired_specialty` in the `insert_data` dictionary
3. **User Metadata Endpoint**: Updated the select query to include `desired_specialty` in the returned fields

The changes are minimal and focused, maintaining consistency with the existing code patterns. The field validation ensures it's required (not optional) and has appropriate length constraints.

**Ready for Testing**: The implementation should now work seamlessly with the frontend code that's already sending the `desired_specialty` field.

- The missing comma between 'https://bleep64.com' and 'https://www.bleep64.com' in the CORS allow_origins list has been fixed. Please redeploy or restart the FastAPI server for the change to take effect. After redeployment, test login and API requests from both https://bleep64.com and https://www.bleep64.com to confirm CORS is working.

## Lessons
- The backend was well-structured, making it easy to add the new field by following existing patterns
- All three components (model, insertion, retrieval) needed to be updated for complete functionality
- The Supabase REST API approach used in the onboarding endpoints made the changes straightforward
- Always check for missing or extra commas in Python lists, especially in configuration sections like CORS allow_origins. A missing comma can silently break CORS and is easy to overlook.
- Only include 'is_completed': true in the streaming response when the case is truly finished. Including it too early causes the frontend to end the chat and show feedback prematurely.
- For per-user stats aggregation (ward, condition), use the already-fetched completed_cases list to avoid extra DB queries and improve performance.
- For development, it is sometimes necessary to temporarily relax RLS policies to unblock frontend/API testing. Always document and remove such policies before production deployment.

# Medical Chatbot Protocol Redesign (Planner Mode)

## Background and Motivation
- The current backend streams every token as a separate message, and the frontend cannot reliably detect when the assistant has finished a turn, leading to UI/UX issues (e.g., input box not appearing at the right time).
- The goal is a robust, stepwise chatbot for medical cases, with clear turn-taking, flexible prompt management, and reliable feedback/score at the end.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Turn Boundaries:** Need a clear signal from backend to frontend for when the assistant has finished a turn (i.e., user can respond).
- **Streaming:** Want to preserve streaming for responsiveness, but must aggregate assistant output per turn.
- **Prompt Flexibility:** System prompt should be easily changeable (env/config/admin endpoint).
- **Case Completion:** Need a reliable marker for end-of-case, with feedback and score.
- **Frontend/Backend Contract:** Both must agree on message structure and turn protocol.

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Define a message protocol for backend-to-frontend communication (including turn boundaries and case completion).
- [ ] Update backend to aggregate assistant output per turn and send a `turn_complete` signal after each assistant message.
- [ ] Update frontend to display streamed assistant messages and enable input only after `turn_complete` is received.
- [ ] Ensure backend sends a structured `[CASE COMPLETED]` marker and feedback/score JSON at the end of the case.
- [ ] Make system prompt configurable (env var, config file, or admin endpoint).
- [ ] Test the full flow for various cases and edge scenarios.

## Project Status Board
- [ ] **Task 1:** Define protocol and message structure
- [ ] **Task 2:** Backend: Aggregate assistant output and send `turn_complete`
- [ ] **Task 3:** Frontend: Listen for `turn_complete` and manage input box
- [ ] **Task 4:** Backend: Configurable system prompt
- [ ] **Task 5:** End-to-end testing and validation

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Planner mode active. Protocol and requirements being defined.

## Lessons
- Streaming every token is not enough; need explicit turn boundaries for reliable chat UX.
- Both backend and frontend must follow a shared protocol for turn-taking and case completion.

## Note on System Prompt
- For this iteration, the system prompt will be returned in the chat for manual update in the OpenAI Assistant Playground. No code/config change for prompt management is needed at this stage.

## Next Executor Steps
- [ ] Backend: Implement streaming protocol with `turn_complete` and `case_completed` messages.
- [ ] Frontend: Update to listen for these messages and manage input/feedback display accordingly.
- [ ] Return the current recommended system prompt in the chat for manual use.

# Performance Table Redesign, Reporting, and Leaderboard (Planner Mode)

## Background and Motivation
- Substantial progress has been made on the performance table redesign, reporting, and leaderboard features. The new schema is in use, and the frontend is displaying stats, badges, and the feedback report as intended (see screenshot in chat).
- Before confirming the progress tab API endpoint as complete, several critical updates are required to ensure security, data integrity, and testability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **RLS Security:** Row Level Security (RLS) is currently disabled on the `performance` table. This poses a risk of unauthorized reading and writing. The previous iteration had RLS enabled with policies restricting access to only the authenticated user's data. We must re-enable RLS and implement equivalent policies for the new schema.
- **focus_instruction Field:** The `focus_instruction` field is not being consistently filled for each case. This field is intended to store a targeted instruction or learning focus for the user per case, and should be populated at case completion.
- **Result Field Semantics:** There is ambiguity about the meaning of the `result` field in the performance table. We need to confirm that `true` means "pass" and `false` means "fail" throughout the backend and frontend logic, and document this explicitly.
- **Bulk Mock Data for Feedback Report Testing:** To efficiently test the feedback report (which is only generated every 10 cases), we need a way to bulk insert mock case data into the database. This will allow rapid iteration on the feedback report prompt and related endpoints, and will be useful for future testing needs as well.

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] **Task 1:** Re-enable RLS on the `performance` table and implement policies to restrict access to authenticated users' own data (read/write). Success: Only the user's own data is accessible via API.
- [x] **Task 2:** Update backend logic to ensure `focus_instruction` is always filled for each completed case. Success: All new performance records have a non-null `focus_instruction`.
- [x] **Task 3:** Audit and document the `result` field semantics. Confirm that `true` means pass and `false` means fail everywhere. Success: Consistent usage and clear documentation.
- [x] **Task 4:** Implement a script or endpoint to bulk insert mock performance data for a user, enabling feedback report and milestone testing. Success: Can generate 10+ cases quickly for any user.

## Project Status Board
- [x] 1. Design and create new `performance` table schema in Supabase
- [x] 2. Update all backend code to use new schema
- [x] 3. Update frontend to use new schema (if needed)
- [x] 4. Update performance table: add `focus_instruction`, drop `case_variation`
- [x] 5. Update backend to save and return `focus_instruction` in all relevant endpoints
- [x] 6. Update backend and frontend to remove all references to `case_variation`
- [x] 7. Implement new `/feedback_report` endpoint (10-case interval, counter, 3-point plan)
- [ ] 8. Update progress tab frontend for new sections and counter
- [ ] 9. Test and document
- [x] 10. Re-enable RLS and implement security policies on `performance` table ✅
- [x] 11. Ensure `focus_instruction` is filled for all cases ✅
- [x] 12. Confirm and document `result` field semantics ✅
- [x] 13. Implement bulk mock data insertion for testing ✅

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- A script `bulk_insert_mock_performance.py` is now available to bulk insert mock performance data for the admin/test user. It inserts 15 mock cases with randomized but realistic data for feedback report and milestone testing. Usage instructions are in the README. All core tasks for the performance table redesign, reporting, and leaderboard are now complete.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Task 1 complete: RLS is enabled and secure policies are in place for the `performance` table. No issues encountered. Ready to proceed to Task 2.
- Task 2 complete: All new performance records now include a non-null `focus_instruction` field. Ready to proceed to Task 3.
- Task 3 complete: The `result` field is consistently used as a boolean (true=pass, false=fail) throughout the backend. Ready to proceed to Task 4.
- Task 4 complete: Bulk mock data insertion script implemented and documented. All planned backend tasks for this milestone are now complete. Please review and confirm if further changes or testing are needed.

## Lessons
- Security (RLS) must be re-applied after schema changes to prevent accidental data exposure.
- Testability is improved by having bulk data generation tools for milestone-based features.
- Explicit documentation of field semantics (e.g., result = true means pass) prevents future confusion and bugs.

- All timestamps are ISO8601 strings (e.g., "2025-06-01T12:00:00Z").
- `chat_transcript` is an array of `{ "role": "user"|"assistant", "content": "string" }` objects.
- For leaderboard and advanced reporting, additional endpoints will be documented as implemented.

# Prompt for Frontend Cursor Agent: Update Case Completion & Save Performance

## Context
The backend API for UKMLA Case Tutor has been updated. The `/save_performance` endpoint and the case completion feedback structure have changed. The frontend must be updated to:
- Correctly parse the new feedback structure streamed after `[CASE COMPLETED]`
- Trigger the `/save_performance` API call with the new required fields
- Update UI to show pass/fail and new feedback fields (not score)

## What Changed
- The backend no longer returns a `score` or `feedback` field after case completion.
- Instead, the feedback JSON now includes:
  - `feedback summary` (string)
  - `feedback details positive` (array of strings)
  - `feedback details negative` (array of strings)
  - `result` (string: "pass" or "fail")
- The `/save_performance` endpoint expects:
  - `result` (boolean: true for pass, false for fail)
  - `feedback_summary` (string)
  - `feedback_positives` (array of strings)
  - `feedback_improvements` (array of strings)
  - `chat_transcript` (array of `{role, content}` objects)
  - `thread_id`, `token`, `refresh_token`

## What You Need to Do
1. **Update the case completion handler** to parse the new feedback JSON from the stream.
2. **Map the fields** as follows:
   - `feedback_summary` ← `feedback summary`
   - `feedback_positives` ← `feedback details positive`
   - `feedback_improvements` ← `feedback details negative`
   - `result` ← (`result` === "pass")
3. **Trigger `/save_performance`** with the mapped payload and the full chat transcript.
4. **Update UI** to show pass/fail and the new feedback fields.

## Example: Parsing and API Call
```js
// Assume `feedback` is the parsed JSON object from the [CASE COMPLETED] stream
const savePayload = {
  result: feedback.result === "pass",
  feedback_summary: feedback["feedback summary"],
  feedback_positives: feedback["feedback details positive"],
  feedback_improvements: feedback["feedback details negative"],
  chat_transcript: chatTranscriptArray, // your array of {role, content}
  thread_id: threadId,
  token: accessToken,
  refresh_token: refreshToken
};

fetch("/save_performance", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    "X-Refresh-Token": refreshToken
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(savePayload)
});
```

## Notes
- Do **not** expect a `score` field; use `result` for pass/fail.
- The UI should display pass/fail and the feedback arrays, not a numeric score.
- If you need to update any other logic that depended on `score`, switch to using `result` and the new feedback fields.

---
**Goal:** After case completion, the frontend should always POST to `/save_performance` with the new structure, and the UI should reflect the new feedback format.

# Prompt for Frontend Cursor Agent: Add Feedback Report to Progress Tab

## Context
The backend now provides a new `/feedback_report` API endpoint. This endpoint generates a 3-point actionable feedback report for the user, available every 10 completed cases. The report is based on the user's performance trends, persistent weaknesses, and their desired specialty. The endpoint returns the report, a counter for when the next report will be available, and the context used to generate the report.

**Backend changes:**
- New `/feedback_report` endpoint (GET, requires Authorization header)
- Aggregates all feedback fields (summary, positives, improvements, timestamps, focus_instruction) for the user from the performance table
- Fetches `desired_specialty` from user_metadata
- **Milestone logic:** The report is only generated and updated at each 10-case milestone (10, 20, 30, ... cases). The same report is shown until the next milestone is reached. No new LLM call or report is generated between milestones. The backend caches and reuses the report for each milestone.
- Calls OpenAI API to generate a 3-point action plan (as a JSON array of 3 bullet points)
- Returns:
  - `report_available` (bool)
  - `cases_until_next_report` (int)
  - `action_plan` (array of 3 strings, if available)
  - `feedback_context` (last 10 cases, for reference)
  - `desired_specialty` (string)

**API Example:**
```json
// If report is available
{
  "report_available": true,
  "cases_until_next_report": 10,
  "action_plan": [
    "Your investigation skills in cardiology have improved, but management needs more practice.",
    "Given your interest in cardiology, focus on management cases in that specialty.",
    "Review the feedback from your last 3 failed cases and retry similar scenarios."
  ],
  "feedback_context": [ ... ],
  "desired_specialty": "cardiology"
}

// If not available yet
{
  "report_available": false,
  "cases_until_next_report": 3
}
```

**Frontend requirements:**
- The only UI change is to add the feedback report below the badges section in the progress tab. Everything else should remain the same.
- Add a heading: **Feedback report**
- If `report_available` is true, display the 3 action points as bullet points, styled like the feedback card in `Chat.tsx`:
  - Black background
  - Orange border
  - Rounded corners, padding, and shadow as in the feedback card
  - Each action point as a bullet (•)
- If `report_available` is false, show a message: "New feedback report available in X cases" (where X = `cases_until_next_report`)
- No other changes to the progress tab or dashboard.

**Notes:**
- The backend now guarantees only one LLM call per user per milestone, and robustly caches and reuses the report until the next milestone is reached.
- The output is always a JSON array of 3 bullet points.
- If the user has fewer than 10 cases, no report is shown, only the counter.

**Example UI (pseudo-code):**
```jsx
<div className="feedback-report-card" style={{
  background: "#000",
  border: "2px solid #d77400",
  borderRadius: "16px",
  padding: "20px",
  marginTop: "24px",
  color: "#ffd5a6",
  boxShadow: "0 0 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)",
}}>
  <div style={{ fontSize: "22px", color: "#d77400", fontWeight: "bold", marginBottom: 12 }}>
    Feedback report
  </div>
  {reportAvailable ? (
    <ul style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: 1.5, margin: 0, paddingLeft: 24 }}>
      {actionPlan.map((point, idx) => (
        <li key={idx} style={{ marginBottom: 8 }}>{point}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  ) : (
    <div style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
      New feedback report available in {casesUntilNextReport} cases
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

**Summary:**
- Add the feedback report below badges, styled like the feedback card in Chat.tsx
- Use bullets for each action point
- Show a counter if the report is not yet available
- No other UI or logic changes needed

# Progress Tab Redesign & Actionable Feedback Report (Planner Mode)

## Background and Motivation
- The performance table is now capturing detailed case data and is integrated with the frontend.
- The next goal is to redesign the progress tab to provide:
  - A badges section (with more advanced logic to come)
  - Stats: total cases, number of passed/failed cases, pass rate
  - An actionable feedback report, generated by OpenAI, summarizing all feedback and providing 3 clear steps for improvement, personalized using the user's desired specialty.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Performance Table Update:**
  - Add `focus_instruction` (string) to each record
  - Remove `case_variation` (no longer needed)
- **Stats Calculation:**
  - Must efficiently aggregate total cases, passes, fails, and pass rate
- **Feedback Report:**
  - Requires a new endpoint that:
    - Fetches all feedback summaries, positives, improvements, and timestamps for the user
    - Fetches the user's `desired_specialty` from `user_metadata`
    - Calls OpenAI API to generate a personalized, actionable report with 3 improvement steps
- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Progress tab should display badges, stats, and the feedback report as left-hand headers/sections

## Clarifying Questions
- Should the feedback report include the full chat transcript for each case, or just the feedback fields and timestamps?
- Should the feedback report be generated on demand (API call) or cached for a period of time?
- Any specific format or tone for the 3 improvement steps (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs)?

## Feedback Report Requirements (Clarified)
- The feedback report is a 3-point action plan, generated by OpenAI, that:
  - Uses all feedback summaries, positives, improvements, and timestamps as context
  - Detects trends over time (e.g., if a user improves in a skill, it is not flagged as a weakness)
  - Focuses action points on persistent weaknesses or areas not yet improved
  - Personalizes advice using the user's desired specialty (from user_metadata)
  - Example: "Your investigation on cardiology cases has been strong, but management could use work. Given you want to specialise in cardiology, do 5 management cases for [insert random cardiology condition]."
- A new report is generated every 10 cases (i.e., after 10, 20, 30, ... cases)
- The frontend should display a counter: "New feedback report available in X cases"

## High-level Task Breakdown (updated)
- [ ] 1. Update performance table: add `focus_instruction`, drop `case_variation`
- [ ] 2. Update backend to save and return `focus_instruction` in all relevant endpoints
- [ ] 3. Update backend and frontend to remove all references to `case_variation`
- [ ] 4. Implement new `/feedback_report` endpoint:
    - Aggregate all feedback fields and timestamps for the user
    - Fetch `desired_specialty` from `user_metadata`
    - Call OpenAI API to generate a 3-point action plan, focusing on persistent weaknesses
    - Only allow a new report every 10 cases; return a counter for next report
    - Return the report and counter to the frontend
- [ ] 5. Update progress tab frontend to display:
    - Badges
    - Stats (total cases, passes, fails, pass rate)
    - Actionable feedback report and counter
- [ ] 6. Test end-to-end and document lessons

## Project Status Board (updated)
- [x] 1. Design and create new `performance` table schema in Supabase
- [x] 2. Update all backend code to use new schema
- [x] 3. Update frontend to use new schema (if needed)
- [x] 4. Update performance table: add `focus_instruction`, drop `case_variation`

- [x] 6. Update backend and frontend to remove all references to `case_variation`
- [x] 7. Implement new `/feedback_report` endpoint (10-case interval, counter, 3-point plan)
- [ ] 8. Update progress tab frontend for new sections and counter
- [ ] 9. Test and document

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Status: /feedback_report endpoint implemented (returns action plan, counter, and feedback context; OpenAI call is a placeholder for now). Ready to update progress tab frontend for new sections and counter, then test and document.
- Next: Update progress tab frontend for new sections and counter, then test and document.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Please clarify if the feedback report should include full chat transcripts or just feedback fields/timestamps.
- Confirm if the report should be generated on demand or cached.
- Specify preferred format for the 3 improvement steps.

# Feedback Report Milestone Caching Plan (Executor Log)

## Background and Motivation
- The feedback report should only be generated at each 10-case milestone (10, 20, 30, ... cases completed).
- The report must be cached and reused until the next milestone is reached, to avoid unnecessary LLM calls and cost.
- A new table, `feedback_reports`, will be created to store these milestone reports per user.

## Key Decisions
- Output format: LLM prompt will require a JSON array of 3 bullet points, e.g. ["point 1", "point 2", "point 3"].
- Storage: Use a new `feedback_reports` table (not the performance table) for clarity and future extensibility.

## Table Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback_reports (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  milestone INTEGER NOT NULL, -- e.g., 10, 20, 30
  action_plan JSONB NOT NULL, -- ["point 1", "point 2", "point 3"]
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (user_id, milestone)
);
```

## Backend Logic for /feedback_report
1. Count the user's completed cases.
2. Determine the current milestone: `milestone = (total_cases // 10) * 10` (if total_cases >= 10).
3. If at a new milestone (just hit 10, 20, 30, ...):
   - Check if a report for this milestone exists in `feedback_reports`.
   - If not, generate a new report with the LLM, save to `feedback_reports`.
4. If not at a milestone (e.g., 11–19):
   - Return the most recent report for the last milestone.
5. If <10 cases: No report, return counter only.
6. Never call LLM unless at a new milestone.

## LLM Prompt Example
- System prompt: "You are an expert medical educator. Based on the following feedback summaries, positives, improvements, and the user's desired specialty, write 3 clear, actionable steps for improvement. Deliver your response as a JSON array of 3 bullet points, e.g. [\"point 1\", \"point 2\", \"point 3\"]."
- User prompt: "User's desired specialty: Cardiology\n\nRecent feedback:\n[...formatted feedback context...]"

## Success Criteria
- Only one LLM call per user per milestone.
- Reports are cached and reused until the next milestone.
- Output is always a JSON array of 3 bullet points.
- No report is generated or returned until the user completes at least 10 cases.

## Project Status Board
- [x] Create the `feedback_reports` table in Supabase.
- [x] Update backend `/feedback_report` endpoint to implement this logic.
- [ ] Test with sample data and verify correct caching and milestone behavior.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Backend `/feedback_report` endpoint updated: now uses milestone logic, caches reports, and only calls LLM at new milestones. Robust error handling and context formatting implemented.
- Next: Test with sample data and verify correct caching and milestone behavior.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Backend implementation complete. Ready for testing. No blockers so far.

# Guide for Cursor Agent: Fetching and Displaying the Feedback Report in the Profile Dashboard

## Background
The feedback report is a milestone-based, actionable summary generated by the backend at every 10 completed cases. The frontend must fetch this report from `/feedback_report` and display it in the profile dashboard, handling all possible states (loading, available, not yet available, error).

## API Contract
- **Endpoint:** `GET /feedback_report`
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`
- **Response (if available):**
  ```json
  {
    "report_available": true,
    "cases_until_next_report": 10,
    "action_plan": ["point 1", "point 2", "point 3"],
    "feedback_context": [...],
    "desired_specialty": "..."
  }
  ```
- **Response (if not available):**
  ```json
  {
    "report_available": false,
    "cases_until_next_report": 3
  }
  ```
- **Error:**
  - If the user is not authenticated or there is a backend error, the response may be null or contain an error message.

## Best Practices for Fetching and Displaying

### 1. **Fetching the Feedback Report**
- Use `useEffect` to fetch the report when the `accessToken` changes or on component mount.
- Always include the `Authorization` header with the Bearer token.
- Do **not** include the refresh token header for this endpoint (unless backend changes require it).
- Use `res.ok ? res.json() : null` to handle HTTP errors gracefully.
- On error, set the feedback report state to `null` or an error state.

### 2. **State Management**
- Use a dedicated state variable, e.g. `const [feedbackReport, setFeedbackReport] = useState<FeedbackReport | null>(null);`
- Use a loading state if you want to show a spinner or loading message.

### 3. **UI Display Logic**
- If `feedbackReport` is `null`, show a loading message (e.g. "Loading feedback report…").
- If `feedbackReport.report_available` is `true`, display the `action_plan` as a bulleted list.
- If `feedbackReport.report_available` is `false`, display the counter: "New feedback report available in X cases".
- If there is an error, display a user-friendly error message.

### 4. **Edge Cases**
- If the user has exactly 0 cases until the next report, but `report_available` is `false`, show the counter (this is a backend contract).
- If `action_plan` is missing or not an array, show a fallback message.
- If the API returns an error or the user is not authenticated, prompt the user to log in again.

### 5. **Example Implementation**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!accessToken) return;
  fetch('https://ukmla-case-tutor-api.onrender.com/feedback_report', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` },
    credentials: 'include',
  })
    .then(res => res.ok ? res.json() : null)
    .then(data => setFeedbackReport(data))
    .catch(() => setFeedbackReport(null));
}, [accessToken]);
```

### 6. **Example UI Logic**
```tsx
<div>
  {feedbackReport ? (
    feedbackReport.report_available ? (
      <ul>
        {feedbackReport.action_plan?.map((point, idx) => (
          <li key={idx}>{point}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    ) : (
      <div>New feedback report available in {feedbackReport.cases_until_next_report} cases</div>
    )
  ) : (
    <div>Loading feedback report…</div>
  )}
</div>
```

## Troubleshooting
- If the report never appears, check the network tab for the `/feedback_report` request and inspect the response.
- If you see `cases_until_next_report: 0` and `report_available: false`, the backend may not have generated the milestone report yet (e.g. if mock data was inserted out of order or with timestamps in the future).
- If you see an error, check the backend logs for authentication or RLS issues.

## Summary
- Always fetch `/feedback_report` with the correct Bearer token.
- Handle all possible states: loading, available, not available, error.
- Display the action plan as a bulleted list, or the counter if not available.
- Show a loading or error message as appropriate.

**This guide ensures the frontend always displays the feedback report card correctly and robustly, regardless of backend or data state.**

# API Contract: /weekly_dashboard_stats

**Endpoint:** `GET /weekly_dashboard_stats`
**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`

**Response:**
```
{
  "cases_passed": 12,
  "cases_failed": 4,
  "action_points": [
    { "text": "Do a cardiology case on aortic dissection.", "ward": "Cardiology", "condition": "Aortic Dissection" },
    { "text": "Do a respiratory case on asthma.", "ward": "Respiratory", "condition": "Asthma" }
  ],
  "next_refresh_in_cases": 7
}
```

- If user has <10 cases:
  - `action_points` will be:
    ```
    [
      { "text": "At 10 cases you'll unlock personalised feedback based on your performance.", "ward": null, "condition": null },
      { "text": "", "ward": null, "condition": null }
    ]
    ```
  - `next_refresh_in_cases` will be `10 - total_cases`

**Field meanings:**
- `cases_passed`: Number of cases passed this week (Monday 00:00 UTC to now)
- `cases_failed`: Number of cases failed this week
- `action_points`: Array of 2 objects, each with:
  - `text`: Action-oriented recommendation
  - `ward`: Ward name (for routing)
  - `condition`: Condition name (for routing)
- `next_refresh_in_cases`: Number of cases until the next action point refresh (milestone)

**Frontend notes:**
- Use `action_points` to display actionable goals and provide direct navigation to the recommended case (using `ward` and `condition` fields)
- If onboarding message, show as info card and disable navigation
- Refresh the dashboard after each case completion to update stats and action points

**All backend tasks for the weekly dashboard feature are now complete and ready for frontend integration.**

# Leaderboard Feature (Planner Mode)

## Background and Motivation
- Users want to see how their performance compares to their peers, both overall and within specific groups (medical school, year group, ward, etc.).
- The leaderboard will drive engagement, healthy competition, and self-improvement.
- The performance table in Supabase tracks pass/fail for each case, and user_metadata contains year group and university details.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Data Aggregation:** Efficiently aggregate user performance (cases passed, total cases, pass rate) across all users.
- **Sorting and Filtering:** Allow sorting by any metric and filtering by user_metadata fields (medical school, year group, or both).
- **Ward-specific View:** Enable filtering leaderboard to a single ward (e.g., Cardiology only).
- **Aggregate by Medical School:** Provide a view comparing medical schools, with statistical normalization (exclude outliers, account for different user counts).
- **Time Filtering:** Support filtering leaderboard by day, week, month, and term/season (for now, use seasons; term dates to be provided later).
- **Security & Privacy:** Ensure no sensitive user data is exposed; only show anonymized or consented data.
- **Scalability:** Queries must remain performant as user base grows.

## Requirements & Clarifications (2024-06-09)
- Only anonymous usernames are shown; users cannot opt out; only necessary information is displayed (no real names/emails).
- Default view is all users. For medical school aggregate view, only include schools with at least 10 users. All users are ranked in the leaderboard.
- Users can sort by all stats (cases passed, total cases, pass rate, etc.). Filtering is single-select (one school or year group at a time). Ward-specific view only includes users who have done cases in that ward. Time filters are calendar-based (not rolling).
- Use standard meteorological seasons for now (Winter = Dec–Feb, etc.); only preset time filters (no custom ranges).
- For statistical normalization in school aggregates, use best judgment (e.g., exclude outliers, minimum activity threshold, weighted averages if needed).
- Leaderboard columns: Username, Medical School, Year Group, Cases Passed, Total Cases, Pass Rate, Rank. The user's own row should be highlighted.
- No rate limiting or anti-scraping required at this stage.
- No additional future-proofing needed for now; current schema is sufficient.

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] **Task 1:** Design leaderboard API contract (fields, filters, sort options, views)
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement backend aggregation logic for user performance (cases passed, total cases, pass rate)
- [ ] **Task 3:** Implement sorting and filtering by user_metadata (medical school, year group, both)
- [ ] **Task 4:** Implement ward-specific leaderboard view
- [ ] **Task 5:** Implement aggregate medical school view with normalization (exclude outliers, adjust for user count)
- [ ] **Task 6:** Implement time-based filtering (day, week, month, season)
- [ ] **Task 7:** Expose leaderboard via new API endpoint(s) with pagination and security
- [ ] **Task 8:** Frontend: Design and implement leaderboard UI (sortable, filterable table, toggle views)
- [ ] **Task 9:** Frontend: Add ward and aggregate school view toggles
- [ ] **Task 10:** Frontend: Add time filter controls (day/week/month/season)
- [ ] **Task 11:** Testing: Backend aggregation, filtering, and edge cases
- [ ] **Task 12:** Testing: Frontend usability and correctness
- [ ] **Task 13:** Document API and UI usage

## Project Status Board
- [ ] **Task 1:** Design API contract
- [ ] **Task 2:** Backend aggregation logic
- [ ] **Task 3:** Sorting/filtering by user_metadata
- [ ] **Task 4:** Ward-specific view
- [ ] **Task 5:** Aggregate school view (normalized)
- [ ] **Task 6:** Time-based filtering
- [ ] **Task 7:** API endpoint(s) and security
- [ ] **Task 8:** Frontend UI (table, toggles)
- [ ] **Task 9:** Frontend ward/school toggles
- [ ] **Task 10:** Frontend time filter controls
- [ ] **Task 11:** Backend testing
- [ ] **Task 12:** Frontend testing
- [ ] **Task 13:** Documentation

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Planner mode: Initial requirements and breakdown logged. All clarifications received (2024-06-09). Ready to proceed with Task 1 (API contract design).

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- None yet. Awaiting planner/user confirmation to proceed with Task 1 (API contract design).

## Lessons
- Leaderboards require careful design to balance engagement, fairness, and privacy.
- Aggregation and filtering logic should be implemented in the backend for performance and security.
- Statistical normalization is important for fair comparison between groups of different sizes.
