# UKMLA Case Tutor API - Add Desired Specialty Field

## Background and Motivation
The user has added a `desired_specialty` column to the `user_metadata` table in Supabase and updated the frontend onboarding modal to capture this information. The backend onboarding endpoints need to be updated to accept and store this new field.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to update the `OnboardingRequest` Pydantic model to include the `desired_specialty` field
- Need to update the `/onboarding` endpoint to handle and store the new field
- Need to update the `/user_metadata/me` endpoint to return the new field
- Ensure proper validation for the specialty field

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Update `OnboardingRequest` model to include `desired_specialty` field
- [x] Update `/onboarding` endpoint to store `desired_specialty` in database
- [x] Update `/user_metadata/me` endpoint to return `desired_specialty` field
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure they work correctly

## Project Status Board
- [x] **Task 1**: Update OnboardingRequest Pydantic model ✅
- [x] **Task 2**: Update /onboarding endpoint database insertion ✅
- [x] **Task 3**: Update /user_metadata/me endpoint response ✅
- [ ] **Task 4**: Test the implementation

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Status: Implementation completed, ready for testing
- Completed: Updated all three required components
- Next: Test the implementation

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**Implementation Complete**: I have successfully updated the backend to handle the `desired_specialty` field:

1. **OnboardingRequest Model**: Added `desired_specialty: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)` to the Pydantic model
2. **Onboarding Endpoint**: Updated the database insertion to include `"desired_specialty": request.desired_specialty` in the `insert_data` dictionary
3. **User Metadata Endpoint**: Updated the select query to include `desired_specialty` in the returned fields

The changes are minimal and focused, maintaining consistency with the existing code patterns. The field validation ensures it's required (not optional) and has appropriate length constraints.

**Ready for Testing**: The implementation should now work seamlessly with the frontend code that's already sending the `desired_specialty` field.

## Lessons
- The backend was well-structured, making it easy to add the new field by following existing patterns
- All three components (model, insertion, retrieval) needed to be updated for complete functionality
- The Supabase REST API approach used in the onboarding endpoints made the changes straightforward
